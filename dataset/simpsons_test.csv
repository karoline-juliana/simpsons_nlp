1,Marge Simpson,"Can I have your plate, Mr. Burns?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"What are you? You're like a monster! That's like the worst thing I ever heard anybody do to anybody. You should be drinkin' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Go, Dad!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, look! Look! A TV Guide owned by Jackie O.!"
1,Marge Simpson,That kind of romance leads to children.
0,Homer Simpson,Mr. John. I'm your biggest fan. I've tape recorded all your songs off the radio.
1,Marge Simpson,My childhood paradise -- it's a dump!
5,Lisa Simpson,But I'm not fruit! I'm a kid!
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, we need to have a talk."
3,Bart Simpson,Maybe we should put a dollar in the jar. Prime the pump.
1,Marge Simpson,That was the last Springfield radio station. Now we just get Shelbyville talk radio.
3,Bart Simpson,"I had no idea, Dad. I just assumed with all the stranglings, you know..."
3,Bart Simpson,"So, you're one of those ""don't call me a chick"" chicks, huh?"

0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, uh. ""H"" is for Homer."
5,Lisa Simpson,We've become pariahs! In the last two hours I've gotten one thousand hate spams.

3,Bart Simpson,I'm busy that night.
5,Lisa Simpson,Poor Maggie. How many insanity hearings have you been to in your short little life?
1,Marge Simpson,This is a celebrity scandal! We could sell that photo to a tabloid.
0,Homer Simpson,Are you ready to laugh?
9,Moe Szyslak,Heh. Life don't seem so hard no more.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh God, my gums! They hurt so much!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, we can't afford that. Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"It looked a lot better in my memory. But do you know what, Smithers? I will find Lilah and win her back... I'll just check with the old gang. Hemingway!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Creative sentencing is common these days. That's why Bill Clinton is our new mailman.

6,Grampa Simpson,I sure did. But why don't we let Homer tell the story.
3,Bart Simpson,I can't get in trouble at school. They put me in the remedial class! I'm surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round!
5,Lisa Simpson,He's waking up!

5,Lisa Simpson,"Da-ad! Oh, Dr. Hawking. We had such a beautiful dream. What went wrong?"
0,Homer Simpson,"But ""Dr. Screwlittle"" sounded like a delightful romp. Well, you don't have to worry about the bill. We've never welshed on a... Look, a bear!"

3,Bart Simpson,"Tonight we're gonna put our fake sores back on, then jump the fence at Club Med, and scare the normals."
1,Marge Simpson,Maybe we should leave.
7,Chief Wiggum,Will too. 'Cause this place is full of witnesses: Apu... that scuzzbag Moe...
0,Homer Simpson,"Look what I got, Marge, a baby monitor."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,That's it! You stay with me. You're the pick of the litter.

5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh great, another invasive Skype from Mil-- huh?"
0,Homer Simpson,My Dad had furniture?! I don't know him at all!

3,Bart Simpson,Rubber knife? This place is for wimps.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh good, you can use that to take down my dinner order. I'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice."

10,Krusty the Clown,"There was your mother, looking like a beautiful mirage."
6,Grampa Simpson,Why is this so hard? I just wanted to marry my best gal.
5,Lisa Simpson,Dad! The 2nd Amendment is just a remnant from Revolutionary days. It has no meaning today.
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, will you make me breakfast?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I knew you'd think it's dumb--"
1,Marge Simpson,Of course. All work and moe play makes Moe a moe moe.
11,Seymour Skinner,"By itself something like this might not call for an extreme penalty...but this is not an isolated incident. Bart's behavior is unruly. He's frequently absent from school, then gives teachers pathetic excuse notes...that are obviously childish forgeries when compared to..."

5,Lisa Simpson,A MOCKINGBIRD WITHOUT A SONG...
1,Marge Simpson,My first gray hair!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. And their MTV's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. You gotta do it yourself, Homer. And you gotta do it fast."

3,Bart Simpson,"Another beer, Dad?"
1,Marge Simpson,"C'mon, Lisa. It's time to go."

1,Marge Simpson,Homer my Mother's party's starting any minute. Get busy.
5,Lisa Simpson,Dad! Bart's on my side of the seat!
6,Grampa Simpson,"Finally, we're doing something I wanna do."
1,Marge Simpson,"Money problems? Homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?"
0,Homer Simpson,Anybody can try! I want you to win!
5,Lisa Simpson,Bald Man's Basketball League?
0,Homer Simpson,"No, no, let me finish. I just want you to know I've always been proud of you. You're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself.

0,Homer Simpson,Eat... my... shorts?! Why you little...
1,Marge Simpson,So much for getting my groove back.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, that would be pretty careless of me, wouldn't it? I keep the real bill right here."
8,Ned Flanders,My place? What would the neighbors think?
6,Grampa Simpson,You accuse me of everything around here. Who put slippers in the dishwasher? Who threw a cane at the TV? Who fell into the china hutch?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Uh... I vant to suck your blood.
0,Homer Simpson,"Finally, a way to combine my love of helping people with my love of hurting people."
0,Homer Simpson,"See, Bart. I saved you."
6,Grampa Simpson,...I leave these. A box of mint-condition nineteen eighteen Liberty-Head silver dollars.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, you don't understand. I can't do it because... you're trapped. If you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! All right! I'll take her. Lousy brain."
3,Bart Simpson,I bet it's a combination to a safe!
0,Homer Simpson,"And we went to the ""Vermont Teddy Bear"" factory. Look what we got! Hm? Hm?"
1,Marge Simpson,"I really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for Dwight. In fact, I really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for everyone at the prison."
1,Marge Simpson,"No, Maggie! Stay in the shallow end."
0,Homer Simpson,I'll write it on my hand...
11,Seymour Skinner,"Welcome to the third lecture in our series on ""Not Putting Things Up Your Nose."" Please welcome Homer Simpson."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, I know you've got a lot of work to do. But this really isn't the same as eating dinner with your family."
8,Ned Flanders,That's right. And I may not go to church tomorrow.
0,Homer Simpson,What do I do? What do I do?

0,Homer Simpson,High? High like a private plane? The kind I'll never be invited to ride on again.
5,Lisa Simpson,'Cause I've wanted to jam with jazz musicians all my life! How would Bart like it if I just hopped on his skateboard and instantly became great?

0,Homer Simpson,"How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it."
1,Marge Simpson,"So like I said, I've never had a tick burrow in so deep. Little guy's just got a mind of his own."

11,Seymour Skinner,Gimme that. Any student caught striking will be severely disciplined. Unless all of you do it. Then I'm stymied.
5,Lisa Simpson,Thank you! I've never felt more accepted. Perhaps one day people who spell correctly will replace athletes at the top of our national pantheon.
8,Ned Flanders,"Eh, eh, just a minute. ""Loser"" is such a harsh word. Couldn't we just say ""the boy who doesn't win""?"
9,Moe Szyslak,But it's illegal! You can't run a bar in a private residence.

6,Grampa Simpson,"Unfortunately, sharks love possum."
0,Homer Simpson,"Maybe I was a little hard on him. Oh, well. Bart, I know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. But what's going on up here?"

4,Milhouse Van Houten,My coat of arms is a Spider-man couchant on a field vert.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,You've got the job. Now get to work.
1,Marge Simpson,I know. And I made your favorite --
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, some women find bald men quite virile."
0,Homer Simpson,I thought we were playing Cincinnati Time-Waste.
0,Homer Simpson,Ooh! Barbecue!
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow honey, eating dinner downstairs is great! Isn't it, kids?"
7,Chief Wiggum,Maybe if I use a pen...
1,Marge Simpson,"Kids, stop exploiting your father. Homie, why don't you lie down and relax."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm sure they're fine, honey."
0,Homer Simpson,Free food?!
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, most women will tell you that you're a fool to think you can change a man... but those women are quitters!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, I think your sister could use a little help washing the car."
8,Ned Flanders,"Hot diggity! How 'bout that, Marge? Li'l ol' Stanley me! ""Stella!"" ""Stella!"" Heh heh."
0,Homer Simpson,"And I've been lookin' for you, too, pal!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Man, when you're not at work, you see so many beautiful things."
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, but my mother always said, ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."""
0,Homer Simpson,I'm drunk!
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, I have thought this through. I will send Bart the money to fly home, and then I will murder him."
0,Homer Simpson,"I can't go back to jail! There's no shampoo, just soap!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,You sure this is safe?
0,Homer Simpson,It's called a double standard. One of the bedrocks of parenting.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,It's like a hamburger milkshake!
7,Chief Wiggum,Boy I bet that looked cool in super slow-motion. Too bad we saw it in regular motion.
0,Homer Simpson,I still don't get it.
1,Marge Simpson,They're terrible.
3,Bart Simpson,Safe at last!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, it's Dad! Right on time!"
0,Homer Simpson,"We'll see, honey."
1,Marge Simpson,My uncle died in your bed. Merry Christmas.
3,Bart Simpson,Keep him away from me.
5,Lisa Simpson,Me!
0,Homer Simpson,"Huh? Oh, right."
3,Bart Simpson,"Good morning, Seymour. You may be wondering what I'm doing with this hat full of maggots..."
0,Homer Simpson,C'mon lads! Let's drive them back to the ocean!
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, get your things. You're leaving with me!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Thanks, I'd like that."
3,Bart Simpson,Mom'll never know...
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh right, we're still doing that."
3,Bart Simpson,I'm doing the Conan O'Brien show and I wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about.
3,Bart Simpson,"I said little help! Throw me the ball, Poindexter."
8,Ned Flanders,I wish we lived in a place more like the America of yesteryear that only exists in the brains of us Republicans.
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, I need help with my science fair project."
1,Marge Simpson,You didn't have to do that. I love you just the same.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you're seeing Krusty everywhere because you want to tell him you're sorry for causing his death. Would it help if I told you you're not responsible for Krusty's death?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Well thanks, Homer."
1,Marge Simpson,"I woke up and you weren't there, and I was so worried..."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Don't worry, Bart, we'll find something fun for you to do."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie... workaholic is probably your best ""aholic"" ever, but you need to relax...so I got us all tickets to see the circus on Saturday."
0,Homer Simpson,"Shut up, Judge!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"See you tomorrow, kids. But before I go I'd just like to say..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Look Marge, I'm Brazilian."
1,Marge Simpson,I think we heard enough about Larry Burns for one evening.
1,Marge Simpson,"They need our support. Besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet."
3,Bart Simpson,But I can't go out dressed like this! What if someone sees me?
11,Seymour Skinner,I guess I could use an affectionate homage.
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh-uh, no way. I don't want to miss a word."
0,Homer Simpson,"Just tell me one thing, Marge. Why did you lose faith in the revue? I mean, ""Cats and Dogs"" writes itself. CATS AND DOGS ON CAPITAL HILL / THEY DON'T GET ALONG AND NEVER WILL"
0,Homer Simpson,"Four Hundred and thirty-seven. Fifty-five. Oh my God, three hundred and... Hey, a hundred and fifty. Oh God, it's two hundred and sixty pounds! I'm a big fat pig."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Superintendent Chalmers, you didn't have to come all the way down here. Everything's under control."
1,Marge Simpson,You're not mad anymore?
3,Bart Simpson,"You are never going to guess what I saw at Martin's party after you guys left! You know that playhouse? Well, I..."
6,Grampa Simpson,"So, who's the father?"
0,Homer Simpson,I guess. You're funny! No wonder Lisa's in love with you.
5,Lisa Simpson,It's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- Can't we do something?
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh, hi Bart. How much this time?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I am missing the back of my head. I think you could cut me some slack."
1,Marge Simpson,It makes her happy.
1,Marge Simpson,"I just can't do that, Homer. It's a matter of principle. And I need you to support me in this."
0,Homer Simpson,"You can look at it this way...or this way...whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like ""Tapped Out."""
1,Marge Simpson,Then stop screaming so loud.
0,Homer Simpson,"I know how you feel, Bart. When I was your age, I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. Well, goodnight."
8,Ned Flanders,Ooh. Who wants to hold Mommy's hair?
0,Homer Simpson,Do you have a table for the mayor?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yep, the four Muntzes!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, with some school band music and added effects, we could show Lisa's film at the public library."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Places where my intelligence will be an asset, not a liability?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ah, me too!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Only if we're the best.
1,Marge Simpson,"Besides, she didn't mean it. It was an accident."
0,Homer Simpson,"I've got you now, boy."
0,Homer Simpson,That's my little slugger.
1,Marge Simpson,President Bush is driving on our lawn! He must be lost.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I'm driving a truck!
10,Krusty the Clown,"All right, let's just move on to notebook two..."
0,Homer Simpson,That'll play great in the sticks.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, that's gross!"
0,Homer Simpson,I wouldn't say that.
1,Marge Simpson,"Very good, Bart."
6,Grampa Simpson,Golf what is?
1,Marge Simpson,Just once I'd like your father to be on a JumboTron for something good.
5,Lisa Simpson,Stop clapping!
3,Bart Simpson,Not up! Down!
3,Bart Simpson,You want me to hang out with Ralph Wiggum?
1,Marge Simpson,Dead in a week? What are you talking about?
0,Homer Simpson,"Which used to be a beautiful, thriving greenhouse 'til I was hired to run it."
3,Bart Simpson,I have found one last myth to destroy -- the so-called legend of Groundskeeper Were-Willie.
11,Seymour Skinner,Fools! Whoops. Still on.
0,Homer Simpson,Ooh! Can I have my special cup?
0,Homer Simpson,Arrgh!
1,Marge Simpson,"Kids, your father and I are going through a really tough time right now. And I don't know what's going to happen, but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess that's everyone. Except earring-boy."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ooh, sorry. Ah, lemme buy ya a drink."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, you can always take the motor out and use it as an ordinary tie rack..."
1,Marge Simpson,Are these Diamondique?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. This is a definite high point for our marriage."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Capital! My mother and I have been performing together since I was in fourth grade, and it's really brought us closer."
1,Marge Simpson,There's no drugs out there.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, get back in bed."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a Tuesday."
0,Homer Simpson,What kind of an example would I be if I didn't take revenge on things?
1,Marge Simpson,Yeah! You don't need a husband to be happy!
8,Ned Flanders,"Neighbor, we've got some work to do."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, no! That's Bart and Lisa!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"That one's fur looks like a tuxedo! A Band-Aid on its tail, awww! Albino!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, that slaked my thirst."
3,Bart Simpson,"I gotta admit, Homer. You're taking this pretty well."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Don't you dare sully this moment with your price taggery! It's perfect!
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, here's a better sign, Dad."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I don't want to live in a world without Bart!
3,Bart Simpson,"Being a free man is great, Milhouse. I can draw on myself with a magic marker."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh now, Homer, they're nothing special. The extra ingredient is care."
0,Homer Simpson,Yieg err meth frau-baii-rr-a hoo-g-minn-d.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us."
0,Homer Simpson,"You gonna finish that, bony?"
0,Homer Simpson,I challenge you to a duel.
3,Bart Simpson,The school's on strike. Maybe forever. Overload. Pleasure overload.
0,Homer Simpson,How did you know?!
0,Homer Simpson,/ Ow!
1,Marge Simpson,But we don't need to come back. We saved the church.
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm too sad.
8,Ned Flanders,"THERE'S A STRANGER IN THE MANGER AND HIS NAME IS LOVE Take it, Homer!"
3,Bart Simpson,"""Fatso Goes Nutso!"" And post to YouTube with the following key words ""fat,"" ""stupid,"" ""classic Simpsons,"" and, just to be safe, ""baby rides kitten rides penguin."""
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah. Next commercial."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ned, that's so generous. But there must be something I could do in return."
3,Bart Simpson,You don't need an introduction. You're the worst kid in school.
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't leave me hangin', Greenspan."
5,Lisa Simpson,"C'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the Sumatran Century Flower."
0,Homer Simpson,A poor delicious buffalo. He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.
0,Homer Simpson,That one I got.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Ice Creamville."
0,Homer Simpson,"You, me and Marge?"
0,Homer Simpson,I know what must have happened:
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, what are you going to do?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Begone from my sight.
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooh, such respect! You could grow up to be a doorman!"
1,Marge Simpson,"I made you some homemade Pepsi for the dance. It's a little thick, but the price is right."
3,Bart Simpson,A little pre-dinner entertainment...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, that's how fast Grampa is shrinking."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, you should have thought of that before I glued all this stuff to my face."
3,Bart Simpson,"Moon pies, my butt... Somebody oughta moon pie her..."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, there is one, but..."
8,Ned Flanders,White wine spritzer!
0,Homer Simpson,Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!
0,Homer Simpson,You know Stan Taylor?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, that's it. I give up."
3,Bart Simpson,This is not about me. Or how many times I voted.
3,Bart Simpson,The bad dog.
0,Homer Simpson,Sorry. I just wanna win my son back so badly.
3,Bart Simpson,Yuk!
0,Homer Simpson,"C'mon out, boy. It's windy."
0,Homer Simpson,"You could close down Moe's or the Kwik-E-Mart, and nobody would care / But the heart and soul of Springfield's in our Maison Derriere..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, if a couple of Chinese bamboo gobblers can win people's hearts, I'm gonna bring them something that man has searched for since the dawn of time."
3,Bart Simpson,It's the coolest video game ever!
8,Ned Flanders,"Say your prayers, Simpson..."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Indeed there will. Budgetwise, of course."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, you have lots of hair... Why did you want to know your blood type?"
0,Homer Simpson,I'll sign with whoever can convince Channing Tatum to gain the most weight to play me.
0,Homer Simpson,"Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she's too smart to fall for that."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Goodbye, Great Aunt Gladys. I wish I had made more of an effort to get to know you these last few years."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, okay. Let's see... Can you do the cranberry sauce?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooo, the Pretender!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, you know, pretty ones. Like that."
0,Homer Simpson,A little lower... a little lower...
0,Homer Simpson,"Give him one of your famous murmurs, Marge."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Don't you see, you're taking women for granted. And aside from being lumped together and generalized about, it's the one thing all women hate."
11,Seymour Skinner,Pass this test and the eggs are on me.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,May I offer you a drink?
0,Homer Simpson,I've hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall.
5,Lisa Simpson,Impaled on my Nobel Peace Prize. How ironic.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, did you close the gate?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, sure you do."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,This just became a treehouse of horrors!
5,Lisa Simpson,But my parents are counting on seeing me dance! And I've worked ever so hard.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Sorry about that. So, Mrs. Simpson, the reason you're here..."
1,Marge Simpson,Wondered where that was.
0,Homer Simpson,GUESSING HOW MUCH ELVIS WEIGHED...
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, that's just the way dogs are. The most disloyal unfaithful creatures God ever made."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, aieeee! There's something on my leg! Get it off! Get it off!"
6,Grampa Simpson,No more drugs. We let everyone down.
5,Lisa Simpson,"But everybody does it! I mean, we're stealing cable as we speak."
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, I think I need some fresh air. Can I go to the park?"
10,Krusty the Clown,That's funnier than I can ever hope to be!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. Whaddaya say, Maggie?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yes, the island."
1,Marge Simpson,"It's like when your father and I left the movie ""Carrie"" right after she was crowned prom queen! She was so happy -- she'd had a lot of problems, but they were all behind her!"
5,Lisa Simpson,So I have two brothers?
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm just glad you're back."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, how did you think I'd feel when I saw that?"
1,Marge Simpson,That's Sideshow Bob!
1,Marge Simpson,Can I interest you in a mincemeat pie? There very...
0,Homer Simpson,"Buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy."
1,Marge Simpson,Homie! We're going to Vancouver!
1,Marge Simpson,I will!
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh... I have no family. I tried to enroll in school, but your Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes."
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage, I can finally look down my nose at you. You have a gambling problem."
3,Bart Simpson,36-24-36...
0,Homer Simpson,Let me just put on some romantic music.
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, I found something!"
8,Ned Flanders,"So Homer, I'm dyin' to know. What do you think of the Leftorium?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, here goes..."
0,Homer Simpson,"No! If you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever."
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, something to share our love --"
3,Bart Simpson,"Show some respect, man! That ""no talent"" created Itchy and Scratchy."
0,Homer Simpson,"A lot of great things have happened to me lately, but they're nothing compared to meeting you. May I have this dance?"
0,Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? Well .
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, don't ever stop, because tonight we made it in New York!"
1,Marge Simpson,I feel kinda silly I walked all the way out here. You're just fine. You always are.
3,Bart Simpson,Can I get out of the dog carrier?
11,Seymour Skinner,"And now, to top off our most propane-explosion-free Science Week ever, our grand finale! The launching of a weather balloon."
1,Marge Simpson,Garden view?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,We'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you decontaminated.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, they say muscle weighs more than fat."
3,Bart Simpson,"If he could go back to being happy, I could go back to being cool."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Muntz, Nelson. You're failing history, geography, and math. But ah, you're doing quite well in Home-Ec."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I got miso!
3,Bart Simpson,Am I?! No.
0,Homer Simpson,"See, son? Telling the truth isn't so bad."
8,Ned Flanders,"What do we have here? The long, flabby arm of the law. The last case you got to the bottom of was a case of Mallomars."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Sir, have you no shame?"
1,Marge Simpson,Ooh... Please be a melon-baller. Please be a melon-baller.
0,Homer Simpson,"So, what brings you here, Mr. Chair?"
5,Lisa Simpson,/ Wow.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm not really a trucker, so I don't talk to the rep that often."
5,Lisa Simpson,GO TO YOUR BED!
0,Homer Simpson,That was awesome!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Look Smithers, a creature of pure malevolence. He's the perfect one to suckle at my proverbial teat."
1,Marge Simpson,Bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and I could have a night out!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I knew I had those installed for a reason.
11,Seymour Skinner,"I said, I'm lop-shouldered! And I have been since I was hung by my armpits in a North Vietnamese prison!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Let's see... ""Uncensored Jump-rope Chants""... Oh, there's a whole thread labeled ""Lisa Simpson!"""
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe, quick! Beer me before I answer the phone!"
3,Bart Simpson,I'm not sure I...
11,Seymour Skinner,"What a load of garbage! I'm ecstatic. With the money from this, we're within striking distance of our trip to Albany."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"In my Dad's apartment, the heat is always off. He made a coat out of all my stuffed animals."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Goldie, you were more than just a goldfish -- you were a member of the family."
1,Marge Simpson,"That's funny. Hm, I don't feel sucked out."
3,Bart Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm the last of the Simpsons!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, it was great! Flew to Tulsa on the company jet. Did my job in a way consistent with what I already told you. Because that's what you do. When you have a job."
5,Lisa Simpson,Things that you're desperately missing from your life that you never knew you needed.
1,Marge Simpson,"So, how are you, Mrs. Krabappel?"
3,Bart Simpson,I knew it. You're there. Just hear me out.
0,Homer Simpson,What the-- Burns gave us those glasses so he could spy on us!
11,Seymour Skinner,There's being right and there's being nice.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thank you. Our top story today: in a move that could affect children townwide, the library book-purchase committee slashed its budget by three percent. First on the chopping block, periodicals."
0,Homer Simpson,"Stay back! I have powers! Uh, political powers!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! I'm clean! In your face, Lord!"
0,Homer Simpson,I AM A LINEMAN FOR THE COUNTY Your call is important to us. Please continue to hold. AND I DRIVE THE MAIN ROAD There are... eight... calls ahead of you. AND THE WICHITA LINEMAN IS STILL ON THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LINE!
0,Homer Simpson,What's the point of going out? We're just gonna wind up back here anyway.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, they can't just build a parking lot on Saber Tooth Meadow. That's where they discovered all those fossils!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh, I missed ya."
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, why did you bring me to a gay steel mill?"
5,Lisa Simpson,They're recruiting people with subliminal messages!
3,Bart Simpson,That guy's been tormenting all of us for years. And I for one am sick of it.
0,Homer Simpson,"Please let me win this, Lord. 'Cause if you don't..."
1,Marge Simpson,That was your idea.
5,Lisa Simpson,What am I gonna do? I need a pinch-runner with speed!
9,Moe Szyslak,That ain't a massage chair -- it's just full of cockroaches.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Ahhhhh!
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new."
3,Bart Simpson,"You mean I should fight dirty, Dad?"
0,Homer Simpson,I'm sick of these constant bear attacks! It's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, until you're sure this guy's cool, stick to your cover story. Oh, that sounds hard. Just do it!"
10,Krusty the Clown,Are those our ratings? Let me see.
0,Homer Simpson,No fair! We just went to church!
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, up to now I thought your hair was blue cotton candy, but now I know it's a solid loaf of brain."

0,Homer Simpson,We were what what in a what what?
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!"
3,Bart Simpson,Ow! You're still doing it.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Dad. I think stealing cable is wrong. So I'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example. It's the last you'll hear from me on the matter. Thank you for your time."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, this is the worst Fourth of July ever. I hate America! Come on, Milhouse, let's go down there."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I can handle the glove. I took juggling at camp.
0,Homer Simpson,"Come on, eat the can. Come on."
3,Bart Simpson,Say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. How about a couple on the house?
5,Lisa Simpson,Maybe one more.
0,Homer Simpson,"Why you, listen to me you..."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh my God. What if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us? Maybe there's better Wi-Fi in the freak tent.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Good morning, Mr. Skinner."
1,Marge Simpson,Homie! Our prayers have been answered!
0,Homer Simpson,Wow. Wow. I never realized you felt about me that way. We should really take some time to talk and...I'd just end up hurting you!
10,Krusty the Clown,"That's funny. So, Marge. Who's your favorite Native American warrior?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, Dad, just twelve more pounds."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I don't want to be a ""Gloom-Hilda."" I guess one beer won't hurt."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, I got off pretty easy."

9,Moe Szyslak,"I am one of them! Hey, I only read Hustler to see the picture of Larry Flynt."
10,Krusty the Clown,But I've always been terrible!
5,Lisa Simpson,"A gumbamel's a camel but faster and humbler. It doesn't take tips and it's never a grumbler. So if you must leave in a kind of a scramble, then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel."
5,Lisa Simpson,Mom! Bart's flicking boogers on me!
3,Bart Simpson,A cherry bomb! I thought I blew all you guys up.
1,Marge Simpson,"God's plan?! God isn't some video gamer up there controlling us like we were pac men and dig dugs! God isn't Sky Police. God didn't do this. I lied to my husband, and made my kids lie too! We did this."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Forget it, Homer. It's Chiro-town."
0,Homer Simpson,"How did the country lose its way, Mel? When did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Two hours with the therapist.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh my God, it's my old boyfriend, Artie Ziff."
3,Bart Simpson,You mean Grampa's old farm?
1,Marge Simpson,"Hello. Hello. I'm-I'm Marge Simpson. And I'm here to talk about a-a-a wonderful, beautiful thing--"
3,Bart Simpson,"Um, that's awesome. But I think I'll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me."
3,Bart Simpson,That I'm not a kid anymore.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, even my personality has gotten, shall we say, an upgrade."
0,Homer Simpson,I'll take that bet.
3,Bart Simpson,Cut! Cut!
3,Bart Simpson,I died when Homer sat on me!
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, listen, if you could indulge me... Larry and I fist-bump every morning. Like that..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I see. Well, you know, fellas, I look at the admissions board a lot like a baseball team. You all like baseball, don't you?"
1,Marge Simpson,Hummingbirds! Hum and get it!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait! How can you be here when your show's on live?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, it's too nice a day to leave Ralph in a closet. You boys should go play outside."

1,Marge Simpson,You're a good father.
3,Bart Simpson,"Lisa's autograph... Apu's autograph... Oh, whaddaya know, Jimbo's real name is Corky... Aannnnd Krusty... Hey! ""Cayman Islands Offshore Holding Corporation""?"
5,Lisa Simpson,I wish for world peace.
6,Grampa Simpson,This show stinks. I knew my son would blow it. Where's the remote?
1,Marge Simpson,I told you you should've stopped the tickling.
0,Homer Simpson,Little Lisa. I've already started you a college fund at Lincoln Savings and Loan.
5,Lisa Simpson,The Renaissance.
1,Marge Simpson,I'd love to! I'll be right... wait... Are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast?
0,Homer Simpson,"Just one of life's mysteries, like why is my nose jammed full of army men?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, you got that right. Thanks for your vote, girls."
3,Bart Simpson,I don't know! I don't know why I did it! I don't know why I enjoyed it! And I don't know why I'll do it again!
7,Chief Wiggum,Sideshow Bob has no decency. He called me Chief Piggum!
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, the freezer broke and--!"
1,Marge Simpson,Stop that! We're guests in Mr. Burns!
6,Grampa Simpson,"Hello. As you may know, I might not be around much longer, so I've decided to give you your inheritance before I die, that way I can see you enjoy it. Lisa, I know you like reading and... so forth... To you I give you my lifetime of personal correspondence."
0,Homer Simpson,Yellow card!
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, I rented another tape... in case you felt better."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ahoy there, Dean! I understand you're taking suggestions from students, eh? Well, me and my Fourth Form chums think it would be quite ""corking"" if you'd sign over your oil well to the local energy concern!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Four-eyes! Vote Quimby! Hey, Beard-o! Vote Quimby!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"I always knew some day Mom would violently rise up, and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors."
0,Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy."
0,Homer Simpson,A bouquet of po...
0,Homer Simpson,Nope. Just lookin' for that golden ticket.
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, I'd love to help, but I did kind of have plans for tonight..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Want it black, don't you? Black like your heart! It's so hard for me to listen to you, I hate you all so much... I'm sorry. It's my problem. I'll deal with it. Please continue."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, if Alec is out, I'm out too. You're on your own, Potsie."

0,Homer Simpson,My name is Homer and I'm just here because the court made me come.
5,Lisa Simpson,Two!?!!!
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, he certainly must have been motivated. Prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able to afford this."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, our top priority is making sure that bird gets well."
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, you can drug me all you want, but my family won't rest till they find my drug-bloated corpse."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, there's one thing you didn't count on: my Dad getting a giant wedding cake and my sister locking herself in the car."
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, it's six fifteen, the kids are in bed and Maggie's in her cage..."
3,Bart Simpson,"I'll show you who's scared. Oh, wow, this really hides my thighs."
5,Lisa Simpson,I didn't mean it like that! A lot of things got changed in the editing room.
1,Marge Simpson,"What are you saying, Homer?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, quit it!"
0,Homer Simpson,So you're shunning us.
1,Marge Simpson,Lisa! What are you doing in the Nutmeg State?
0,Homer Simpson,Whaat?
1,Marge Simpson,Simpson gene? That's just foolishness.
0,Homer Simpson,"At last, we're alone..."
3,Bart Simpson,Aha! No one's around. The perfect crime.
3,Bart Simpson,"All that happened is we got a little extra vacation, is that so bad!?"
1,Marge Simpson,Normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on TV. But this season...
9,Moe Szyslak,I got four hundred nos.
0,Homer Simpson,"It's a murder, honey. A group of crows is called a murder."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ivana Tinkle. Just a sec. Ivana Tinkle. Ivana Tinkle. All right, everybody put down your glasses. Ivana Tinkle."

0,Homer Simpson,"Now, I will take your questions."
5,Lisa Simpson,Uh... deux... troi....
6,Grampa Simpson,I can't go to Miami -- I'm expecting calls from telemarketers!
0,Homer Simpson,"No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. I call him Gamblor. And it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws."
3,Bart Simpson,Wait a minute. This ain't no genius copter. This is con air!
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, as the tree said to the lumberjack -- I'm stumped."
0,Homer Simpson,"They'll grow back, right?"
7,Chief Wiggum,Pull over!
1,Marge Simpson,They sound angry... and Africanized.
10,Krusty the Clown,WE'VE HAD LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF FUN/ BUT NOW THE TIME HAS COME... TO GO/ IF THIS OLD CLOWN WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS BED TOMORROW/ I'D BE IN HEAVEN STILL DOING THIS SHOW.
0,Homer Simpson,"This doesn't look easy, but I'll bet it is."
0,Homer Simpson,"Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you. I need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all, I need you to love me, because I love you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Transport yourself to the shores of Nova Scotia, where cod and halibut frolic in--"
1,Marge Simpson,Homer really did need those injections.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Um, excuse me, Mr. Smithers, Bart may be seriously hurt. Could we possibly go ahead of you?"
1,Marge Simpson,Fine. You're on the jury.
3,Bart Simpson,He's great! He pokes fun at life's little foibles.
5,Lisa Simpson,"/ Oh, he got overthrown!"
6,Grampa Simpson,All the good graves are taken.
0,Homer Simpson,"Burns never gives money to anybody. Just last week, I asked him for fifteen hundred dollars."
0,Homer Simpson,"I can explain, Marge! Please let me explain! Oh, why won't you let me explain!!!"
3,Bart Simpson,Betty.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Silence! You call yourself a Chinaman?
5,Lisa Simpson,Let's just pray this hits the prison.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge please, control your jealousy. This is your daughter!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, and that's why his sweatpants say ""HjorleifsstrÃ¦ti"" across the butt."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sure, by their standards, but we live in America."
5,Lisa Simpson,Drugs.
1,Marge Simpson,Can't you do something for him?
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, look, a corn maze!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you cannot endorse Ted Nugent. I mean, sure, we all love his music..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... split it with them?"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, I get it. You're here to tell the kid he can't wrestle with his Grampa."
0,Homer Simpson,Just give me ten more hours.
1,Marge Simpson,Why do you have so many bowling balls?
1,Marge Simpson,"A hundred and one frozen pops. A Nobel Prize winner... an NBA All-Star... Ooh, one of the ""Sweathogs!"""
0,Homer Simpson,Lousy Democrats.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,... and that's how you win an opium war!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hello, little fella."
1,Marge Simpson,Take off the 3-D glasses!
1,Marge Simpson,Without. Let me go!
0,Homer Simpson,One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation.
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, our first hang-out with the cool new neighbors. I've already ""blown them away"" -- their words, I assume -- so don't screw it up."
10,Krusty the Clown,What the--?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Juliet."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Did they jump on the pile to smoosh it down?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Keep your noses clean, and your hearts free of worms."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Leave him alone, you vultures!"
8,Ned Flanders,It won't start! Something's draining the battery?!
0,Homer Simpson,You seem like an impartial observer. But I've been fooled by so many people in costumes.
1,Marge Simpson,Yes. 'Cause every time you wear it you'll know how much we love you. Like the one pair of blue pants I bought Homer twenty years ago.
0,Homer Simpson,Okay. But at least let me take the boat out for one last spin!
1,Marge Simpson,I was just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
1,Marge Simpson,"Mr. Burns, you want to see me?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Forget about it, Homer. You made it to the top. You're the coolest Dad ever."
5,Lisa Simpson,It's Mrs. Hoover's birthday!
0,Homer Simpson,You can supervise me.
3,Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Willie!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Where's he going?
0,Homer Simpson,"Really? Boy, it sucks to be you. Anyhoo, if there's one thing I know, it's how to win back a furious woman. We'll go to her house, and I'll whisper to you exactly what to say."
5,Lisa Simpson,Oooh! Aaah! Ohhh!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, grow up."
3,Bart Simpson,Fine. We'll divide the car into your side and my side. My leg is the barrier.
0,Homer Simpson,Flanders! What are you doing here?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, about forty, I suppose. When are we going on the air?"
1,Marge Simpson,Where'd you get that champagne?
3,Bart Simpson,...where my soul will be chopped into confetti and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers...
3,Bart Simpson,Bitchin'.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I appreciate the thought, but my pen won't write on this. How am I supposed to do the ""Junior Jumble?"""
1,Marge Simpson,I'm looking for a film critic to help judge our festival. Did you know there are over six hundred critics on TV and Leonard Maltin is the best looking of them all?
0,Homer Simpson,Ayyyy!
1,Marge Simpson,I'm just happy you're back. Now let's get that chain off you.
0,Homer Simpson,Why thee little...
0,Homer Simpson,Plant-watering guy.
3,Bart Simpson,"You know, I'm almost eleven, it's not really fair."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Who decided that the electrons we produce can't stand for something greater?
3,Bart Simpson,"C'mon, Springfield. Sparkle for me, baby. That's it..."
3,Bart Simpson,He thought that trip to the guillotine factory was just for fun. But it was the perfect place to shoot him.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, those girls you paid to scream are doing a great job."
0,Homer Simpson,Maybe we should get going.
1,Marge Simpson,"No, no, no!"
3,Bart Simpson,BUT A TANGO TAKES TWO!
0,Homer Simpson,It's at times like this I wish I were a religious man.
5,Lisa Simpson,I can see that down deep is a decent man.
1,Marge Simpson,"You got it, little buddy."
10,Krusty the Clown,What was I on?
1,Marge Simpson,I see a hair.
0,Homer Simpson,"It's KURNS, stupid!"
0,Homer Simpson,You can race pigeons?
0,Homer Simpson,"What'sa matter, buddy? The American flag not good enough for ya?"
0,Homer Simpson,A boat!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Gere, I was hoping Buddhism could bring me inner peace. Or is that just a pipe dream?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Mom! We need a Callaway titanium perimeter-weighted driver!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Pshaw, I say!"
0,Homer Simpson,Website.
0,Homer Simpson,I'll write you a check.
5,Lisa Simpson,See who?
1,Marge Simpson,"Hm, I never figured him for the bully type."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie."
0,Homer Simpson,Now to take care of the witnesses.
0,Homer Simpson,"Nice doin' business with you, boy."
0,Homer Simpson,"Whew, that's all of 'em. And I'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. How 'bout a present, son?"
5,Lisa Simpson,YOU had a stamp collection?
5,Lisa Simpson,Eiw.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, don't do that!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, right. Chinese guy, Chinese guy, frisbee dog..."
0,Homer Simpson,Don't mind if I do.
0,Homer Simpson,What the--? Half goes to Bart. Half goes to my Vegas wife. What's left for Moe?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Remember, Dad. All glory is fleeting."
1,Marge Simpson,Step on it!
3,Bart Simpson,I admit it! I let Milhouse lie down in your bed!
6,Grampa Simpson,Typical Canadian wimpiness. That's why you have snowballs and we have the H bomb.
0,Homer Simpson,All right. Stop it! Cut it out!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,How about a benchwarmer who's afraid of puppets?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Now, your case requires someone who understands the twisted mind of a murderer. And I know just where to find him."
0,Homer Simpson,"I know you're mad at me right now, and I'm kinda mad too... I mean, we could sit here and try to figure out ""who forgot to pick up who"" till the cows come home. But let's just say we're both wrong and that'll be that."
5,Lisa Simpson,It just gets worse and worse.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,That's about three more jeopardized gunboats than I'd expect.
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Huh? Oh, myself, I guess."
0,Homer Simpson,But he's a loser. He's pathetic. He's...
4,Milhouse Van Houten,But I'm hungry now.
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm really gonna miss him.
8,Ned Flanders,"Pays for itself after the 16th visit. You know, most people don't know the difference between apple cider and apple juice. But I do. Now here's a little trick to help you remember..."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I'm intrigued! What are the rules?
3,Bart Simpson,"No! If the government finds out he's here, they'll dissect him!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer. It's not the end of the world. You know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh, isn't that fun?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"A lotta attitude in that hand, Lou."
6,Grampa Simpson,"For me, that's a perfect day!"
6,Grampa Simpson,I wish this show had a visit from three new writers.
9,Moe Szyslak,Aw crap. I fold.
0,Homer Simpson,"Help me! Are you helping me, or are you going on and on?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Bart Simpson, I'm just big-boned."
1,Marge Simpson,Now who has ideas for this year's fundraiser?
6,Grampa Simpson,"Ah, nertz to that! Homer I fed you and clothed you till you were thirteen! If that's not a father, I don't know what is! I'll be waiting for your apology on the ""old man"" bench at the mall!"
11,Seymour Skinner,Unauthorized meat-a-pult. Off the list.
0,Homer Simpson,Now you're telling me Burns's story?
0,Homer Simpson,Beautiful. We have confirmation.
1,Marge Simpson,I knew they'd try to convert you! That's what they do! Well I'm not having another twelve kids.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, it looks like everything worked out just fine for everybody."
5,Lisa Simpson,"...So because of your on-base percentage, Nelson, you're the new leadoff hitter. Questions?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Maude, eh?"
0,Homer Simpson,Investor confidence? Perhaps this affects me -- I own two hundred and thirty million shares of ZiffCorp stock.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Bart, don't you see? This is what psychologists call over-compensation. Mom is racked with guilt because her marriage is failing."
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, you look so successful. Like you're the wife of a businessman."
8,Ned Flanders,"Stan, tell you what -- Homer Simpson here is just about the biggest Atom fan that's ever graced God's green earth. I bet he'd enjoy it, even more than me."
3,Bart Simpson,Oh baby!
5,Lisa Simpson,What do you like best about me?
11,Seymour Skinner,"""Lisa..."" ""Lisa..."" ""Lisa..."" Wow, she even beat perennial write-in candidate ""Skinner Sucks."""
3,Bart Simpson,"Greta, is this how it is?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Goodbye, Bluella! Send me a post card from Tierra Del Fuego!"
1,Marge Simpson,We are not staying at Moe's. Maggie's already drunk on the fumes. And she's a mean drunk.
0,Homer Simpson,You have a new home now... with us.
0,Homer Simpson,Use only in a well ventilated area.
8,Ned Flanders,"So! This is how you repay me, Adam!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Now. I'll give you directions, starting from the Simpsons' house..."
3,Bart Simpson,What kind of game?
3,Bart Simpson,Piano lesson.
3,Bart Simpson,I've set up a trust. It bypasses the inheritance tax.
3,Bart Simpson,Damn FDA. Why can't it all be marshmallow?
0,Homer Simpson,Gimme that knife!
1,Marge Simpson,Don't you think we should wait for Lisa? She is the President.
0,Homer Simpson,"MAX POWER / HE'S THE MAN / WHOSE NAME YOU'D LOVE TO TOUCH / BUT YOU MUSTN'T TOUCH / HIS NAME SOUNDS GOOD IN YOUR EAR / BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT, YOU MUSTN'T FEAR / 'CAUSE HIS NAME CAN BE SAID BY ANYONE..."
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, looks like it's time for another ""'End of the Walk' Talk With Homer and Ned."" Tonight's topic: ""The Niceness of the Evening."""
5,Lisa Simpson,And hanging Christmas stockings!
5,Lisa Simpson,And why aren't I at school?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Super."
3,Bart Simpson,You're a bread compartment!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Yeah, well, you should be. I only stole two sandwiches and a bag of Doritos."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Not on my carpet!
0,Homer Simpson,"Son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. Also, don't be a cow."
1,Marge Simpson,Mm-hmm!
3,Bart Simpson,"I did go away, Mom! I was miles and miles and miles away, writhing in agony in the pits of Hell. And you were there! And you! And you! And you! You I've never seen before."
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm afraid what I like can't be swallowed, sniffed or smoked."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, four A.M. Now I'll never get back to..."
9,Moe Szyslak,"So, now you think you can just waltz in here and buy everybody a beer?"
1,Marge Simpson,"No, we're out."
5,Lisa Simpson,Yes I do! Sure I do! Look!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Gentlemen...
3,Bart Simpson,Let's just say he's a few prawns short of a galaxy.
1,Marge Simpson,No! What if he's crazy?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, are all these pockets necessary?"
3,Bart Simpson,Crashing down!
5,Lisa Simpson,That sounds okay...
0,Homer Simpson,"Good, good... You call Moe."
0,Homer Simpson,Heh-heh... mule.
0,Homer Simpson,"Just keepin' you on your toes, babe."
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, I promise I'll be good."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Roger that.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Kids, this Mother's Day, why don't you give your mom what she really wants: a break from you! Have your dads take all you annoying kids on a Krusty Krustival Kruiseline Day-Kruise to historic Weasel Island, one of America's ten roundest islands!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent! Your first duty will be to step out on the balcony and tell that crowd this plant is safe.
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, pal..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, campus! Do you have a statue of the founder I can stick a funny hat on?"
10,Krusty the Clown,Whatever.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Mattingly, for the last time, get rid of those sideburns!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Look Pop, I'm planning some expert home repairs, and I need a pair of bolt cutters, or wire cutters, or something to get the lock off my toolbox."
9,Moe Szyslak,I decided to do the right thing.
3,Bart Simpson,"Heh, funny, isn't it, Lis? Those people down there have no idea how close they came to complete destruction."
0,Homer Simpson,Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.
3,Bart Simpson,You've filled my head with horse poop and atheism! And all these years I thought I was unteachable.
0,Homer Simpson,Except... I killed Mr. Burns.
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, your training wheels come off your bike."
5,Lisa Simpson,One last sunbeam... and we're done.
0,Homer Simpson,Let me check my reason list.
0,Homer Simpson,Look out for the stairs!
0,Homer Simpson,No shade!
8,Ned Flanders,Uh hmm. That's right. I'm like Baskin Robbins. You get one free taste then you gotta buy the scoop.
0,Homer Simpson,It's your sister.
3,Bart Simpson,The Haunted Mine.
0,Homer Simpson,People will do anything a sign tells them.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hellooo Springfield! It's me, Homer!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, you missed the turn-off, Mr. Warren."
3,Bart Simpson,"I can't take Mr. Burns to the ho'pital 'cause I'm too dumb to read a map. Oh, why did my school have to close?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, son."
0,Homer Simpson,I still wanna see it.
5,Lisa Simpson,Stop! You are in violation of the Model U.N. Charter!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, I get it now. Thanks, Bart."
1,Marge Simpson,No-No-NO-NO-NOOO!
0,Homer Simpson,Who knew that anger was savin' my life?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"But, I can assure you and the public that there is absolutely no danger whatsoever --"
3,Bart Simpson,Um-hm. I bet they sell them in Utah.
3,Bart Simpson,Have you tried looking for him?
1,Marge Simpson,I've bonded with him!
5,Lisa Simpson,Well I'm glad you're not upset. All my extra credit points are like frequent flyer miles on a bankrupt airline.
0,Homer Simpson,Better call Dr. Hibbert.
0,Homer Simpson,Deacon? Is that like one of those weird Catholic Priest things?
5,Lisa Simpson,Fine. What's their number?
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, the happy sound of a blender."
1,Marge Simpson,One month? That's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and Chinese food. But I can still ruin soft drinks for everyone."
5,Lisa Simpson,I'll bet she's sneaking food from someplace else! Let's follow her!
1,Marge Simpson,And maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.
5,Lisa Simpson,Embrace nothingness.
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw, rats, another gutter ball! Gee, Homer, you sure do suck tonight!"
0,Homer Simpson,Chunkylover53.
1,Marge Simpson,Apparently including tying the knots on the hammock.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, uh, he did try to kill me..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ew, I can't watch this."
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, listen, Lisa--"
0,Homer Simpson,We'll have Christmas tomorrow!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Marge, easy!"
0,Homer Simpson,And the Cosby Mysteries! That show had limitless possibilities!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess I should pay my share..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm, yes. I believe that's little Maggie Simpson -- the baby who found my precious teddy-bear Bobo. Oh and there's that, ah Simpson mutt, my former guard dog."
1,Marge Simpson,Let's stick to original Monopoly -- the game is crazy enough as it is.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hear ye, hear ye! What's for breakfast?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"That's my final offer, take it or leave it."
0,Homer Simpson,What's going on? And I want the non-gay explanation.
0,Homer Simpson,Wait a minute! That word you keep calling me --
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, don't look at me... just because I'm holding a pair of scissors. Scissors which I need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains."
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, I locked your keys in the car."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh! Yeah. Monty's a wild man! Yeah!
0,Homer Simpson,Dad --
0,Homer Simpson,"...so I threw the super ball so hard it hit the ceiling twice, then broke a lamp."
5,Lisa Simpson,No. Homework's not my father's specialty.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Me? Well, I, uh, for a living? Well, there's all kinds of things a fella can do, such as... hemming, and hawing, and uh, but me, I'm a highly respected uh... therapist for alcoholics."
1,Marge Simpson,I'm back here.
0,Homer Simpson,I just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty!
1,Marge Simpson,"Come right this way, Mel. I... Tim, hold my calls."
0,Homer Simpson,Stupid mongoose! get the snake! The snake! Do I look like a snake? Ow! Ow! He bit me Show's over! Show's over! Next show is eight o'clock and ten!
3,Bart Simpson,I gotta be honest -- I don't see what all the hubbub is about.
1,Marge Simpson,We were gone for two weeks!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, no! We're headed for Victoria Falls!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Is it possible to get a green spotlight?
8,Ned Flanders,I figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at Lisa's recital.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, it's a little over the top, but there's no reason I can't look good and take back the playground from the gypsies."
0,Homer Simpson,What a great job. And I could use a job right now.
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm okay, I'm okay."
0,Homer Simpson,Hel-lo.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, look Marge! They're still not fightin' back! I can be a jerk and no one can stop me! Hee hee hee hee!"

3,Bart Simpson,"Grampa, you were the original bad boy!"
5,Lisa Simpson,That's what heroes do.
0,Homer Simpson,Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh yeah? Well, there's your girlfriend."

0,Homer Simpson,"That's right. I love you Marge, and I realize now I should show you more often. The end of your book was the wakeup call I needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book."
9,Moe Szyslak,I got it. It's okay!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, who cut something out of my paper?"
0,Homer Simpson,Why did I give her a gun? But I repeat: no one is being replaced by a machine. Until all the kinks are worked out.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, don't drink and drive!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Twist off, dammit!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Hi-didly-ho, Schuss in Boots."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on. You've been gunning for queen bee ever since you buzzed into this hive. Now serve!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.
0,Homer Simpson,Dave's not here! Dave's not here!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hold on, I'll check. Ah, is, I.P. Freely here? Hey everybody, I.P. Freely?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"You know, just because you say something is crazy, doesn't make it so. And just because you think museums are boring and demolition derbies are fun, doesn't make that true either!"
11,Seymour Skinner,But?
3,Bart Simpson,But she doesn't melt.
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait. Yes, it's staying down. Oh no, it's not! Yes it is. No it's not! Yep. No. Yep. No! Yep. No! Yep. No. Yep. No. Yep. no."
0,Homer Simpson,You keep thinking that!
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, lotta hysteria..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, it looks like Maggie crawled through these bushes, spit up over here, and crashed her tricycle into the wall."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"It's too late, Bart. My Mom's already transferred her 401K."
1,Marge Simpson,"The Moms and I had a falling out, which was a shame. We had been such good friends."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oooh, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find... a little cheeky."
3,Bart Simpson,But not today. I think I'm just gonna hang out at home.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, hold perfectly still for seventy-eight minutes..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, I want to say something extremely important the way a woman does: subtly through someone else. Kids?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, after six weeks, I figured out that ""Sensei Weinstein"" is really my psychiatrist."
1,Marge Simpson,Bart! That's not right.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Aw, don't get excited. It's just a skull-shaped rock and a buncha white sticks."
5,Lisa Simpson,Where are they going?
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, I know I haven't been the best Jew... but I rented ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and I will watch it. Anyway, can I have forty-thousand dollars?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Are you saying we won't see my family again?
1,Marge Simpson,"School's starting, Bart. Aren't you excited? This year you learn about local history!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Geez, Flanders. You're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'."
0,Homer Simpson,BY THE BIG COOLING TOWER...
0,Homer Simpson,Remember our honeymoon?
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I'm sorry you couldn't feel for old Joe."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, with the old ball and chain gone, maybe I can finally have a little fun at the office."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, she's a real purist."
3,Bart Simpson,They found a switchblade in my locker.
11,Seymour Skinner,Whoever brings down that balloon doesn't have to learn fractions!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, it's my first MyBill. Twelve hundred dollars?! But I only downloaded... twelve hundred and twelve songs!"
8,Ned Flanders,Not so deep the Lord can't find him... and judge him.
5,Lisa Simpson,"What is ""zazz""?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Lis, I did some checkin' on this Allison character and I know it's against all your moral fibers..."
3,Bart Simpson,He's out there playin' basketball!
9,Moe Szyslak,And the funniest ingredient... the venom of the Louisiana Loboto-moth.
10,Krusty the Clown,Know him? He's my worthless half brother.
0,Homer Simpson,Well I'm not finished. Where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,This isn't the flag! It looks more like... Ewww!
0,Homer Simpson,You're right. It's time to rebuild my self-esteem.
3,Bart Simpson,"See, it's all legit. Now make with the party."
10,Krusty the Clown,Our next match is Marge and Bart Simpson...
1,Marge Simpson,"Ew, Homer, there is a bird on your head?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, I was wondering if you'd join me. My treat."
10,Krusty the Clown,The best thing is I can get locally-sourced monkey meat.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I know you're not wild about having me for a babysitter, but I'm not some ogre. I think you will find me fair and fun."
0,Homer Simpson,"Keep it moving, Marge. This isn't a parking lot."
5,Lisa Simpson,Isn't that cute? A bush-baby.
0,Homer Simpson,"Nice. You know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs. Tell me about one."
0,Homer Simpson,You're a useless old man! Name one thing you do for this family.
5,Lisa Simpson,Shouldn't you people be groveling? And bring me some shoes. Nice ones!
0,Homer Simpson,This will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay.
3,Bart Simpson,"No way, JosÃ©."
5,Lisa Simpson,And vice versa.
0,Homer Simpson,"Charlie, wanna grab a beer?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you're not laughing. Too subtle?"
3,Bart Simpson,Thank you! Thank you!
0,Homer Simpson,But that's Barney's seat. Are you tryin' to make me the new Barney?
0,Homer Simpson,Missed me! Stupid horoscope!
1,Marge Simpson,"Chief Wiggum, Homer and I are innocent."
1,Marge Simpson,What a great day.
5,Lisa Simpson,Shh. TV.
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay. All right, pie, I'm just gonna do this."
5,Lisa Simpson,Yes. Ten please.
3,Bart Simpson,I got out of school because I told them I was mangled in a car wreck.
0,Homer Simpson,How could I not? I saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. I saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into America's already bloated snack-hole. So I did what I could. I did what any loving husband would do: I reached out to some violent mobsters.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, how are you. Nice to meet ya."
3,Bart Simpson,Woo! All hands on deck! Pirates off the port bow! Hey!
8,Ned Flanders,Righty-o!
5,Lisa Simpson,What if he...
1,Marge Simpson,I meant a real guitar.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, did you call one of your friends?"
3,Bart Simpson,What any boy would: push you in a puddle and run away.
1,Marge Simpson,And your bottom was a little bigger.
0,Homer Simpson,Did that really happen? Or was it just a wonderful dream?
3,Bart Simpson,"But I've set you free. No more nap time, no more bingo. You can do whatever you want!"
1,Marge Simpson,You looked so peaceful lying there.
0,Homer Simpson,Still?
0,Homer Simpson,'Cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.
0,Homer Simpson,"All right turkey. Where are you? Turkeys, the only animal smarter than man."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, then just give me the drinking bird."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's this? ""Marge's Memory Chest."""
11,Seymour Skinner,"I'm very sorry to hear that, Willie."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, you choked!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, look at me! I'm Blanche Dubois!"
1,Marge Simpson,"That's the last of them. You did the right thing, Bart, and now you can keep the money."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Uh... well...
0,Homer Simpson,Now that's religion.
3,Bart Simpson,Must be a secret government project.
1,Marge Simpson,You're thirty-nine.
1,Marge Simpson,"With Bart gone, and now you and your father, I'm not going to have anyone to--"
3,Bart Simpson,Krusty was supposed to sign this. Take it back and make him sign it.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, folks -- you've been a great audience."
1,Marge Simpson,"I think I'm going to like this ""America."""
3,Bart Simpson,She has no friends.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Let me take care of that. If there's one thing I know how to do, it's manipulate Barts."
0,Homer Simpson,Only 'cause he tried to reason with him.
0,Homer Simpson,"It's the Rapture! Quick, get Bart out of the house before God comes!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Stupid prison guard job thinks its so big. Everyone gets a prison job but me. All my best friends are guards. They think they're so cruel and corrupt, but they're not."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I... look, I don't suppose... you'd never want to... uh... I dunno... get together sometime?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Now, Homer, we can't have you burglarizing us every time you've got a bill to pay."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ah, so you don't have that killer instinct. Big deal."
0,Homer Simpson,"Now we have to drive it straight to Rome, where it'll be shipped to Mr. Burns in Springfield."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Ah, the hell with you. I just might ask that Selma girl out. And you can't tell me not to! My roof, my rules!"
0,Homer Simpson,I'm proud of what I achieved during my rioting.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, so you're looking for a Mr. Smithers, eh? First name, Waylon, is it? Listen to me, you... when I catch you, I'm going to pull out your eyes and shove 'em up your pants so you can watch me kick the crap out of you. Okay? Then I'm going to use your tongue to paint my boat."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,What are you eating?
0,Homer Simpson,"How 'bout ""I love you, honey?"""
1,Marge Simpson,"No. I'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. Homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while."
0,Homer Simpson,QUIET STEPS ARE WHAT I TAKE / SNEAKING IN AT NOON...
0,Homer Simpson,Pretend to care!
5,Lisa Simpson,I'll start with Radio Shack.

0,Homer Simpson,Sometimes there's not a train going by.
7,Chief Wiggum,"It's a Yard King. That is a quality barrow. Well, gotta run."
0,Homer Simpson,Benedict Arnold!
1,Marge Simpson,"I think it's a very nice idea. Don't you, Homer?"
5,Lisa Simpson,How about asking the community for donations?
5,Lisa Simpson,I just want to study.
3,Bart Simpson,There's gotta be a way to get back at Dad.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, Lenore."
5,Lisa Simpson,Something tells me he is.
3,Bart Simpson,"Whoa, a solid gold animal cracker."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! I was a fool to help that horrible old man!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, we'll worry about that after you're elected."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hm, I'm gonna need a bigger drill."
5,Lisa Simpson,The Noisy Minority... The Upside-Down Bubblegum Collective... The Regional Lampoon... The Plymouth Grok Experiment... Fro And Flo... Allan Sherman's Helter Shmelter...
0,Homer Simpson,"You like sweets, kids? I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. You'd spit them out! You would! I'm talking about the Candy Industry Trade Show. ."
10,Krusty the Clown,Let's just keep smooching till everything sorts itself out.
1,Marge Simpson,Why didn't you tell me you felt this way?
0,Homer Simpson,Lisa! It's me! I'm in trouble!
5,Lisa Simpson,So what prize did you end up getting?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Mr. Flanders, I see you're reading the newspaper."
0,Homer Simpson,"Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog."
5,Lisa Simpson,They cannot keep making dolls like this! Something has to be done!
0,Homer Simpson,Hey! Mr. Burns needs our help!
0,Homer Simpson,I could walk up to the President and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.
1,Marge Simpson,And nobody does it better.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, maybe my headache will go away once the show starts."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, okay, okay. Where do you want to go?"
0,Homer Simpson,DAY BY DAY... DAY BY DAY... THE DEACON'S JOB... IS PRETTY OKAY... PRETTY OKAAAY... I'M GOING TO BE A DEACON... DAY BY DAY... I'M ALREADY A DEACON... DAY BY DAY...
5,Lisa Simpson,You're an undercover cop?
10,Krusty the Clown,They don't?
0,Homer Simpson,Wha?! I heard a yell. Did you touch a wire?
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, I smell cake! Cake that says ""Farewell"" and ""Best Wishes""!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Sweet dreams, boys."
6,Grampa Simpson,Crucify him!
5,Lisa Simpson,We fooled her... Betsy.
1,Marge Simpson,Mike Scioscia! Didn't you get radiation poisoning working at the Springfield Nuclear Plant?
7,Chief Wiggum,"""Quarter Pounder with Cheese."" Well, I can picture the cheese... But, uh, do they have Krusty Partially-Gelatinated Non-Dairy Gum-Based Beverages?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Not now, Marge."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Ma-arge! Want some com-pany? As always, silence means yes."
1,Marge Simpson,But seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Yeah? Lawsuit? Oh, come on! My ""Seven words you can't say on TV"" bit was entirely different from your ""Seven words you can't say on TV"" bit. So I'm a thief, am I? Well exCUSE MEEEEEEEEE!"
10,Krusty the Clown,...girl with big...
5,Lisa Simpson,You haven't heard the last of this!
6,Grampa Simpson,The metric system is the tool of the devil. My car gets 40 rods to the hogshead and that's the way I likes it.
0,Homer Simpson,Huh? But that's impossible.
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah -- I have no job and nowhere to go. What do I have to buy so I can sit here all day?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ah, face it, Bart. Our salvation isn't just gonna roll by on the Back of some stupid truck."
3,Bart Simpson,"But, if you get elected, you can change all that, and stop those stupid airplanes from flying over my house."
3,Bart Simpson,"Boy, show business is kinda cruel, isn't it?"
10,Krusty the Clown,The golem would perform any task that was written on a scroll and placed in its mouth.
0,Homer Simpson,"Lady, please. Get back in your overturned car. Let the guys handle this."
1,Marge Simpson,"I don't care if the sink shoots sludge, we're having a party."
1,Marge Simpson,It deals with a bookish young woman's efforts to enter Rabbinical school.
7,Chief Wiggum,Am I getting warmer?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, that's our book for the year -- I think we've earned some TV."
3,Bart Simpson,"No! Stop! No ""Star Wars"" parodies!"
3,Bart Simpson,He'll never read it.
0,Homer Simpson,Who else is in it?
6,Grampa Simpson,"Aw, I think you're cute, too."
7,Chief Wiggum,There he is. Behind that shopping bag...
0,Homer Simpson,"You guys are the lousiest garbage men ever! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! You trash-eatin' stink bags!"

0,Homer Simpson,"Well, then you'd better turn up your hearing aid, Pops."
0,Homer Simpson,"Take it like a man, boy. And do everything your little sister says."
5,Lisa Simpson,You know what I think killed this place? No one wanted to drive to the middle of the forest for clams.
3,Bart Simpson,You're just imagining things.
3,Bart Simpson,The principal said potty!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Any of these islands would make a fine new country.
9,Moe Szyslak,Eh... which means what?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Please, I've had enough attention for one day!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Hmm. You've never heard of recycling? It means to reuse things to conserve our natural resources.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't have what it takes to play guitar. I mean, I'm no Joe Walsh in the brains department."
0,Homer Simpson,"I don't know, but that would be hot. ""Once upon a time there was a young prince of Denmark."""
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, um, well, I'm looking at a lot of murder sites right now. Where's the bedroom?"

5,Lisa Simpson,He ruined the one chance I had of getting to know Mr. Bergstrom outside of school.
1,Marge Simpson,Pick one.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I do have a favor. Patty and Selma came home early from their vacation, but the cleaners still haven't gotten all the black mold out of their apartment..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Actually, I think it--"
3,Bart Simpson,"No, not in my mouth! Aye--is what the kid would say. To the bluffs!"
0,Homer Simpson,Dammit! This circus Wi-Fi is a joke!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,At once! Do you hear me?!
0,Homer Simpson,Don't tell my kids I'm going to jail! Tell them I've joined the Blue Man Group! I'm the fat one!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip. Think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, why are they saying you're going to fight Drederick Tatum?"
6,Grampa Simpson,It might as well be in China.
3,Bart Simpson,"Lisa, I only lied because it was the easiest way to get what I wanted."
11,Seymour Skinner,"For the next week I stayed alive by eating my mother's delicious preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball with my one free hand. I made a game of it, seeing how many times I could bounce the ball in a day, then trying to break that record. Occasionally the police arrived to search my home."
3,Bart Simpson,Wowww... That's good Squishee.
3,Bart Simpson,It wasn't dad's fault. The ape tricked him. What's next?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I may have a use for this Simpson character higher up in the organization.
1,Marge Simpson,"Honestly, it wouldn't bother me."
3,Bart Simpson,This dame is really into you!
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, Mr. Edison, I did it. I'm an inventor! And I owe it all to you."

3,Bart Simpson,"Say, I hear a foghorn. BOR-ING..."
1,Marge Simpson,"I think about you, too."
5,Lisa Simpson,They're not evil! They believe in friendship and respecting the earth... and they made me feel like I belonged.
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay. I'll take some white meat and stuffing to go... and, send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hokkaido, eh?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, I've never been so proud. You both deserve a big, big reward!"

9,Moe Szyslak,"You know, as long as we're opening this up and I'm glad you are, I wanna tell you guys that when you call me a gargoyle, a troll, or a homunculus, it kinda hurts my feelin's."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,You guys!
0,Homer Simpson,Give my Dad another heart attack?!
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh... apron, boobs-face?"
0,Homer Simpson,Waldo. Waldo. Waldo.

0,Homer Simpson,"Come on machine, take my dollar!"
0,Homer Simpson,And some stuff I wanted.
0,Homer Simpson,Now wait just a minute -- I used to worry Marge was too good for me. She was always thinking of ways to improve me. But then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. So we're all where we want to be.
5,Lisa Simpson,In the first place... do whatever you want. I'm getting' a candy apple.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, kids!"
0,Homer Simpson,Could you give my wife a few lessons?
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm out of beer."
8,Ned Flanders,"Uh, it's an angry mob, ma'am. Could you step outside for a twinkle while we knock down your house?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, let's face it. I'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. And there's only one way out: I've gotta man up. Okay, manning up... manning up. Mannning-- Girling down! Girling down!"
0,Homer Simpson,That's m'name.
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, where did you get those?"
6,Grampa Simpson,I switched the names on the DNA samples. Then I put my name first on the list for a new heart.
3,Bart Simpson,No. This Ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life. And I'm gonna wreck it. Because he scarred me forever!
5,Lisa Simpson,This wasn't in the brochure.
1,Marge Simpson,"Pointy, pointy, spiky, stylish... Where's baldy?!"
11,Seymour Skinner,I wanted you to be the first to know. I'm going to ask for your Aunt Patty's hand in marriage.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, leave Simpson alone."
0,Homer Simpson,"May the spirit of Retsin be with you all year long. God bless God, amen."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, make sure you don't. And try not to let your brother get under your skin."

5,Lisa Simpson,Are we really gonna live here and grow crops?
0,Homer Simpson,Got him! Uh-oh.
0,Homer Simpson,Whatever. Knock yourself out.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that's good!"
1,Marge Simpson,"This box? Oh, nothing."
1,Marge Simpson,Why all the black?
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh-ho, we are so there."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Just try to remain inconspicuous.
3,Bart Simpson,Actual Sword Attack!
5,Lisa Simpson,We're building homes for the homeless.
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, I will!"
0,Homer Simpson,Uninspired.
0,Homer Simpson,Really? I'm surprised about Maggie.

5,Lisa Simpson,BAAARRTT!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh no, I've got to take it away before more clueless kids fall into it!"

0,Homer Simpson,Sure. What is it?
0,Homer Simpson,"""Decalcify calcium ducts?"" Well, gimme a Y. Gimme a--"
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge needs help, and God knows, I'm not the man to provide it. But I know who can..."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Y'ever been huntin' before there, Barty?"
0,Homer Simpson,Oh please take me back. The dating scene is a nightmare. I'm begging you!
0,Homer Simpson,Stupid dog.
6,Grampa Simpson,It was my job to clear the roads of enemy explosives.
0,Homer Simpson,To date!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, I'm afraid we've got a budget problem, Mrs. Simpson. Your boy picked a bad time to fall down a well. Had he done it at the start of the fiscal year, no problemo."
3,Bart Simpson,Gross! Weird! Complicated! Go to sleep!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, whoa, whoa. Let's not tamper with a classic."
0,Homer Simpson,Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with the hammer?
11,Seymour Skinner,Flawless logic. But I am going to have to ask you to speak a few phrases to verify your fluency.
0,Homer Simpson,"Y'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooh, I heard about that place on ""The Red Grocer."""

1,Marge Simpson,NOOOOOOOO!!
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, you're the bee's knees, baby. I missed you bad."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Great at the chewin', not so hot at the swallowing."
6,Grampa Simpson,I'm okay! I'll just go live with my son!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent! Now, what have you got for me?"
0,Homer Simpson,It kills me to see her like that. And if there's one thing I can't stand it's being killed.
3,Bart Simpson,No I mean it. It really hurts!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, they drugged the tea. They knew my one weakness."
0,Homer Simpson,You give this delightful frozen treat the same respect you would give any lactose-free food. God bless America!
1,Marge Simpson,If you could just ease up on the eating after three a.m. That's all I ask...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, what a boon it could be for our under-funded public schools."
8,Ned Flanders,I was wrong!

3,Bart Simpson,Can I have something to go with my turnip?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, Moe's getting a big screen TV in February. Just in time for the Pro Bowl. Maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win."
5,Lisa Simpson,Is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me?
0,Homer Simpson,"So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey Homer, you ever think about racing that bird?"
11,Seymour Skinner,Life insurance? Hmmm... Will I be able to borrow against the equity?

0,Homer Simpson,So you're back on the winning team?
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, thank you, sweetheart, but what should I do with this dirty, ill-gotten money? I better throw it in the garbage."

3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, a mint condition ""Hippie Hulk"" from 1968!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, I'll never get that game."

0,Homer Simpson,The greatest fight ever and I missed it.
3,Bart Simpson,"Now, drop your pants."
0,Homer Simpson,"Three hundred and six, three hundred and seven..."
0,Homer Simpson,Two can play at that game.
0,Homer Simpson,Bart?... Bart!
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! I'm trying to work!
3,Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, she's only dating you to get back at me."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, tell your child what you bought when I sent you to town to get some insurance."

0,Homer Simpson,It's working!
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is amazing. I never realized some restaurants are better than others."

0,Homer Simpson,"No, no, that'll be fine, thank you, goodbye."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ma-arge. They can't carry enough candy. They have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you."
0,Homer Simpson,It's how the pros do it.
0,Homer Simpson,Now let's see... which one is Ling?
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe, I was just thinking, if Maggie and I were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham."
0,Homer Simpson,Correct. Now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. But why does the American flag have precisely 47 stars?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, ball!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, Burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, I'll tell you that. He's going to have to give me... my own recording studio."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Clueless fanboys in costume!
3,Bart Simpson,Some say the ducks went to Canada. Others say Toronto. And some people think that Joe used to sit down there... near those ducks. But it could be that there's just no room in this modern world for an old man and his ducks.
5,Lisa Simpson,THEN ALL THE REINDEER LOVED HIM / AS THEY SHOUTED OUT WITH GLEE / RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER / YOU'LL GO DOWN IN HISTORY...

5,Lisa Simpson,I must have him!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Huh. Well, that car thief can't hold his breath forever."

8,Ned Flanders,Son of a gun-diddily-un! Those gilded edges smart!
3,Bart Simpson,I don't want to be the next anything. I'm only taking this stupid class because they made me.
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. I'll build you a new treehouse. One so grand it'll be an affront to God himself."
7,Chief Wiggum,"We're puttin' you away, Kicky Mantle. And give that can the whole C.S.I. treatment. You know, lab tests, weird lights, shots from the can's point of view..."

9,Moe Szyslak,But honey --
0,Homer Simpson,Wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish in a fresh water aquarium?
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! Homie? Hm... what he's typed will be a window into his madness.

0,Homer Simpson,"Oooo. Pro wrestling from Mexico. You know, down there it's a real sport."
10,Krusty the Clown,"I don't need your charity titters. Now, say hello to my girlfriend, Charity Titters."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes. You see, you're a left-hander. And so is the pitcher. If I send up a right-handed batter, it's called playing the percentages. It's what smart managers do to win ballgames."
1,Marge Simpson,It sure was nice to have a day together as a couple.
8,Ned Flanders,Teen abstinence counseling! You get to pass out abstinence pledges and make sure the kids sign their John Han-bleeps.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,That's my girlfriend.
3,Bart Simpson,So even though I'd love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes. It's not...
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, I don't think this is such a good idea."
1,Marge Simpson,"Sure, steak."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"But you can escape -- and use this map to retrieve my buried treasure. With it, you can have your revenge!"
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm the little hell-raiser, sir."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't know how to punish you! What does Marge usually do?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad! Dad, a little help?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Man, this is crazy. I hope I didn't brain my damage. I'd better check my pupils..."
0,Homer Simpson,"I warned you he was an idiot. Well, all I need is some moonshine and someone playin' the har-mon-a-key, and I'm as happy as a pig in plop!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Whooop de-doo, Mr. Florist! Whoop de-doo, Mr. Physical Trainer! Whoop-de-doo, Mr. President!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Man, that Princess Tempura is one heck of a Transformazoid."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ugh, those morons make me so angry."
1,Marge Simpson,Stop Milhousing your sister!
0,Homer Simpson,I gotta go back... Fix future...
0,Homer Simpson,Yep. It's on here.
11,Seymour Skinner,...doomed to get only single pneumonia.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hm. For a man who likes electric cars, he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"How does he do it, Smithers?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, don't say that. The way I see it, if you raise three children who can knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger, you must be doing something right."
3,Bart Simpson,Or you could let me go play with Milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable Mexican sitcoms.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, Dad. How many people have seen the ice caps and the deserts all at once, or the majesty of the northern lights from one hundred miles above?"
0,Homer Simpson,Go gamecocks!
3,Bart Simpson,Now you'll get the girls you seek!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,She came in on a Saturday. Missed her kid's karate demonstration. He was goin' up a belt.
0,Homer Simpson,Poor Wiggum.
0,Homer Simpson,Now that's what I call a moon shot.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, you tell me that all the time."
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay kids, we only have time for a quick visit to Grampa, so as soon as he feels loved, we're outta there."
0,Homer Simpson,"Honey, I bet you're wondering why Daddy's not at work again. The answer may surprise you. I have a new job choreographing end zone dances for a professional football player."
3,Bart Simpson,"""The spotted hawk accuses me, he complains of my gab."""
1,Marge Simpson,"Uh, well..."
1,Marge Simpson,He was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I was just driving around the mid-Atlantic states, ringin' doorbells at random, and I just... oh, who am I fooling with my awesome lies? I want you to come back to Springfield."
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, I can foretell people's deaths!"
3,Bart Simpson,Whoa! This Oreo is rank.
1,Marge Simpson,Soy sauce!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. And besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. Nothing serious."
3,Bart Simpson,Huh?... S'matter?
1,Marge Simpson,...she had married a brute.
1,Marge Simpson,I'm proud that you won the Pulitzer...
0,Homer Simpson,That's the sweetest thing any baby has ever done for me.
3,Bart Simpson,"We've seen it, dad."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, right, Mom. Then I'd like a rattle and a wowwipop. Actually, I would like a wowwipop."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Bart. Don't say things you can't take back."
0,Homer Simpson,This party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan.
1,Marge Simpson,"Dad, don't you want to know where we're going?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's okay. The baby's name isn't important. Let's go, Marge."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I've never seen them fight like that, Bart. I'm worried that all this posturing and saber-rattling could lead to a teachers strike."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Frightened, Bart? Welcome to Stage Three: Fear."
0,Homer Simpson,"Why did I ever have kids? I could have written symphonies, or been Shakespeare."
0,Homer Simpson,... ...
3,Bart Simpson,Grampa?!
9,Moe Szyslak,"If Boner here is gettin' cuts, I want 'em too."
0,Homer Simpson,Bart! Don't interrupt!
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. You don't want the truck, I need a job, you need money, I'm flush with severance pay..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, Fat Load here."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, why did you burn my centerpiece?"
0,Homer Simpson,"People know your name, but you don't know theirs. It's great."
0,Homer Simpson,"I got hung up at the snack stand -- watching those hot dogs rolling and turning, not a care in the world."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Oh. I saw your car by the gate and I, well I thought you might be lost hikers. 'Cause then I could rescue you, and-and be a hero, and-and maybe the city would give me a coupon for free guitar lessons ha."
3,Bart Simpson,"Da da da da da da de de de Whoa! Ugh, Cowabunga!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Office of the Solicitor General? ""Office of the Prime Minister?"" ""Hopping Mad Collection Agency?"" What is all this stuff?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Because you envy us. Maggie and I share the deepest bond there is: sisterhood.
0,Homer Simpson,Unguarded stuffff...!
0,Homer Simpson,This cell phone is so I can call you whenever I need your driving services. I've put in my own ring tone!
0,Homer Simpson,More for me.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Huh. You hear that world?! They love my ideas, just not me! And that is half the battle! Ha!"
1,Marge Simpson,Is everything okay? I got worried when I didn't hear any shots.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Geez, Homer. I never seen you so depressed. As your life partner, I'm very worried."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I've designed a new plane. I call it the Spruce Moose, and it will carry two hundred passengers from New York's Idlewild Airport to the Belgian Congo in seventeen minutes."
5,Lisa Simpson,It's so cool to have another musician in the family!
3,Bart Simpson,I'm fine. Just fine.
5,Lisa Simpson,I already read it.
0,Homer Simpson,Hold it right there!
3,Bart Simpson,You were right about watching him fly.
5,Lisa Simpson,Sorry. I just came to see how you were feeling.
3,Bart Simpson,Better -- the prospectors left naughty French postcards!
0,Homer Simpson,And she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.
0,Homer Simpson,Hmm... Hillbilly moonshine -- the little witch is right!
3,Bart Simpson,"No I didn't, Dad."
0,Homer Simpson,Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws.
1,Marge Simpson,He should be honest... and caring... and well off... and handsome...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Miss Midler, I can't believe you do this all by yourself."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Oh, no! Nooo! No, no, no, no."
1,Marge Simpson,They miss their father. Are you sure you don't want to take him back?
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh, we can work this out, friends. In the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Stop! Leave Milhouse alone! Help me out here, Bart."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Wow! While I was sitting here feeling sorry for myself, Bart's invention actually changed someone's life!"
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm just happy you're excited about something besides saving the whales. Face it, they're doomed!"
3,Bart Simpson,It's probably my imagination but something about them didn't seem quite right.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,We'll be safe on this Battleboat.
1,Marge Simpson,That's it! We're outta here.
3,Bart Simpson,I'm tending to Martin's butterfly enclosure. His butterflies are emerging from their chrysalises tonight.
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah. You did! You told me when something's bothering you, and you're too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut. At least that way you won't make things worse."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis, guess who's got a genuine Itchy and Scratchy animation cel?!"
3,Bart Simpson,Trick-or-treat! Lick my feet! Your head smells like pig-butt meat!
1,Marge Simpson,"She's coming home for Christmas! And Bart's bringing the boys! And Lisa's coming with Zia! For once, the whole family's going to be here for the holidays!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Mmm-mm. Oh, I can feel the pounds just melting off."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I'm bored. Let's go switch the heads on the Cosby Kids.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Yes, the school nurse did a wonderful job reconstructing his little face after the fight. Goodbye, son. I guess you were right. All that homework was a waste of your time."
0,Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo! I got a date with my daughter!
0,Homer Simpson,I can't believe I destroyed the Earth.
10,Krusty the Clown,"A great man once observed: ""Ninety percent of success is showing up on time."" Sorry I'm four hours late. Now let's pick a Krusketeer!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Why are we getting dressed up, Mom? Are we going to Black Angus?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Mindy, because of our uncontrollable attraction, I think we should avoid each other from now on."
3,Bart Simpson,"No, he hasn't. He's more the same than ever. And I know where the evidence is. There's only one place it could possibly be."
0,Homer Simpson,Kill my boss? Do I dare live out the American Dream?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,One day it'll all pay off.
1,Marge Simpson,Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Before we begin, children, may I remind you the school computers are not to be used to access PrincipalSkinnerStinks.com, Skinnersucks.org or Shavedskinner.edu."
9,Moe Szyslak,"So Maya. Um, you always been this size, or is this like a Benjamin Button deal? No, I mean is, I just...your picture just made you look more... life-sized."
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, there's a lot of low cards in that hand. But since we're both free, why don't you and me hit the town?"
3,Bart Simpson,Scuba goggles!
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Marge'll fix everything."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Girls don't laugh, and they don't buy cigars. Dutch Masters is gonna drop us like a hot potato!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, I apologize to you. I was wrong. I take it all back. Always be yourself. You want to be sad, honey, be sad. We'll ride it out with you. And when you get finished feeling sad, we'll still be there. From now on, let me do the smiling for both of us."
3,Bart Simpson,"No, no, I mean..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Jimmy is such an ugly word, Marge. Unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits."
7,Chief Wiggum,"If those animals aren't gone by midnight tomorrow, Animal Control is gonna round 'em all up."
0,Homer Simpson,That tree's been in Springfield since the time of our forefathers. Give it back or we'll bust in there and take it!
11,Seymour Skinner,I will hang up when he leaves.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, this year's gonna be different."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, if I died, would you be sad?"
7,Chief Wiggum,Thank you. You have restored our village and our way of life.
5,Lisa Simpson,"There's you, Dad!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, uh, we've never had a dance before. Lisa, you'd be doing all the work. What do you think?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Bart! You're just pretending to know what I'm talking about.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, listen to you. ""Ooh, ooh, I'm too old to change. "" How old are you?"
1,Marge Simpson,How can you take it? We haven't found it.
3,Bart Simpson,"No, I don't!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Four ""Lobster-politans"" comin' up!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Hey Marge, I don't I don't really want a computer. You know all those complete strangers Googling each other. Makes my flesh crawl."

2,C. Montgomery Burns,The one who shot me was...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, you look so sophisticated -- just like Mary Hart!"
3,Bart Simpson,I'm telling her!

4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, the school's having a bake sale."
3,Bart Simpson,My Gramma? I haven't seen her in years. She ran away.
5,Lisa Simpson,But it's not fair. Adults always blame kids for everything!
0,Homer Simpson,Great! Great! Great! How much? How much? How much?
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, it's celebrity boy-toy Ned Flanders and his arm candy, Sara Sloane."
3,Bart Simpson,Or isn't there not?

0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, Moe, you sure look angry. Here, have some nuts."
5,Lisa Simpson,He's dreamy.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Maybe I should get that sick one. If I don't, no one else will. Bart, list your top five, best to worst. No, no, no, no -- worst to best!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Can we?
0,Homer Simpson,"Ah, come on, Lisa, there's no reason to... Let's go see Mom."
0,Homer Simpson,Here ya go. Have some more.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I think it's good for a show to go off the air before it becomes stale and repetitive."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, it is an honor to be asked. But I never make a final decision in the middle of a forest at night."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Uh, he's saying, ""We wouldn't dream of sacrificing the blue-haired woman!"""
5,Lisa Simpson,"No,me!Takeme!Me!Me!Me!"

0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, I know that horse! It's Sudsley! Sudsley Brew-Right!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Tomorrow?! Well, that's too bad, mister. I'm not gonna bail you out this time."
1,Marge Simpson,Stop that! And get ready! We're going to the old folks' talent show. Now get washed up.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Let me explain. I have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if I give up hope. Now if you don't mind, and with all due worship, I would like to be alone."
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw. It's no use, Milhouse. If we're gonna find that lemon tree, I've got to go undercover. What I need is a new face."
3,Bart Simpson,I know that I got you mad once in a while...
0,Homer Simpson,But... all right.
1,Marge Simpson,"Look, this really made me feel vulnerable. I want to know how soon you think you'll catch this guy."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yep, but you're still safe at home. After a few practice trips here, the real Kwik-E-Mart will be a piece of cake. Now, Bart will play Apu..."
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, boys. Let's get this tape back to the lab for analysis."
6,Grampa Simpson,I was! But I've come back... as your love testing machine!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, there's one left and it's mine!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, that's a post-dated check, remember. Don't cash it 'til the year ten thousand."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Actually, we can't take a bath anyway. The water heater is broken."
6,Grampa Simpson,Wait for me! I'm a-comin'!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Fernando, it's ""M.B."""
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, yeah? Well, I dare you to yank his beard off."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer kept saying he could do a more realistic family show. Finally, I said, ""So, do it! Either shit or get off the pot."""
5,Lisa Simpson,I don't think we should be down here.

3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah. Hop in, Homer."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I love this song."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, he sure sucked the fun out of that poem."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"No. For once, I wanna go first."
6,Grampa Simpson,"So we sealed up the paintings, knowing only one of us would ever look upon them again."
3,Bart Simpson,"Before you kill me, remember, this trip is ""All Expenses Paid."""
0,Homer Simpson,And I promised these guys money I don't have! And they're gonna be so mad!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Behold, an ancient subway station!"
1,Marge Simpson,KRUSTY
5,Lisa Simpson,"My mother would like to enroll in ""Painting From Life, 2-B""."
3,Bart Simpson,Beats the hell out of me.
0,Homer Simpson,Lousy family...
9,Moe Szyslak,I never get tired of that.
3,Bart Simpson,Hell.
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, there. That's better."
0,Homer Simpson,Now I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...
0,Homer Simpson,"That's ridiculous, honey. You're the cutest little girl I know. You just have what is known as the Simpson butt. Permit me to elaborate."
0,Homer Simpson,Here we go. Now it starts with the fees.
0,Homer Simpson,"What're you, the narrator?"
5,Lisa Simpson,That means that Springfield's presidential primary will be first in the nation! Even earlier than New Hampshire!
1,Marge Simpson,But that doesn't mean that you can't have a little dinner.
0,Homer Simpson,I stole a rack of fur coats. I sell one a year to pay for Christmas.
0,Homer Simpson,Okay. Lemme check the specs.
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm fine.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Stay away from me, Bart. I mean it, I'm not goin' back. I'm not cut out to be a star."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, that was pretty good."
0,Homer Simpson,"As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer Simpson, that painting has torn the town apart, destroyed Kirk and Luann's marriage, and everyone's very worried about Milhouse."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hey, wait a minute. Those are hot dogs. Armour Hot dogs."
6,Grampa Simpson,"So with those words, Mabel and Virgil headed north."
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! They must have made a mistake. We'll just go down to the phone company and straighten it out.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, get the camera offa me -- I'm narratin' here!"
9,Moe Szyslak,How tragic. Tell me more.
3,Bart Simpson,Skateboards? You copycat wannabes.
0,Homer Simpson,Hel-lo? Hel-lo Einstein? I said a place to put my drink. You know those Super Slakers they sell at the Kwik-E-Mart? The cup is this big!
0,Homer Simpson,"In America, first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women."
1,Marge Simpson,"Seventy-two lousy events, and Grampa hasn't won a single medal."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Here, take my hanky."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, don't use the ""b"" word around me. It's offensive."
9,Moe Szyslak,I don't think you're ever going to get another job and be able to pay me back.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, geez, I told you, Bernie. To guard the bee."
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh, I should say not. I gave up on L.A. when those TV people made that poor nun fly. All those Puerto Ricans lookin' up her dress. That's not right."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm here to deliver a package to Marge Simpson.
0,Homer Simpson,"We made it, son. International waters -- the land that law forgot."
1,Marge Simpson,Horses only live thirty years!
0,Homer Simpson,Well excuse me for having enormous flaws that I don't work on!

0,Homer Simpson,Our first job is to entertain...
0,Homer Simpson,"Homer's not here, man."
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, this is it, Carl's family home. Twenty-two..."
1,Marge Simpson,"But, Homer, it's so expensive."
1,Marge Simpson,Just make it happen!
10,Krusty the Clown,This is our final night. Thirty contestants have already fallen through our Buzz Cola trap door.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ew, no thanks."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"So, Jenny, I hear you're religious. Know what my favorite book of the Bible is? Revelations."
0,Homer Simpson,"I have a plan to deal with that. Step one: change everything about ourselves until we are super cool, the end."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Maybe we can find an answer in this bookstore.
8,Ned Flanders,"Look Homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. So, I don't want to be hard on you... but I just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the big deal? It's just some new guy moving in!"
0,Homer Simpson,But I'm up two hundred thousand dollars! Give me my money!
10,Krusty the Clown,Wilbur Mudd!

5,Lisa Simpson,Can I dye my shoes pink?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Have you ever been in a police car?
3,Bart Simpson,There's no change in your piggy bank.
1,Marge Simpson,Please. I need people here who are helpful and sensitive.
0,Homer Simpson,No sale.
0,Homer Simpson,That's what I've been saying. We're all fine the way we are.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Homer stole our rock performance. That fat, dumb and bald guy sure plays some real hardball."
10,Krusty the Clown,"I'd just like to say this thing is worth nearly two million dollars. How do you like me now, Teen Choice Awards?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Hide the sports section!
3,Bart Simpson,Because I can make it so the other kids don't laugh at you so much.
7,Chief Wiggum,"If there's a body in here, we'll drag it up."
5,Lisa Simpson,A deer!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Did you hear that? That ""excellent"" was... excellent."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Nicely done, Wind-dancer. But seriously, cruelty to animals is no laughing matter. You can make a difference!"
0,Homer Simpson,What? What play?
3,Bart Simpson,They killed off Radioactive Man?! I did not see that coming. Die carumba.
5,Lisa Simpson,Well I can't do it tomorrow. There's an assembly in his honor.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey there, Little Red Riding Hood. I ate your granny and now I'm in the mood for love."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Brick by brick, I seal his doom."
3,Bart Simpson,"Boy, that took forever."
1,Marge Simpson,"Uh, kids... don't forget about our special plans Saturday night."
3,Bart Simpson,I can try.
1,Marge Simpson,"Excuse me, everyone. I'm a mother."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Uh, I didn't go to movies as a kid. Spent all my time at the pierÃ³gi factory. Dab the potato, fold the dough. That was my Star Wars."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, there doesn't seem to be any pattern, yet. But if I take this one and move it here, and move these over here... Hello... It almost looks like an arrow."
0,Homer Simpson,I am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Is this how you imagined your life, Edna?"
1,Marge Simpson,Power.
3,Bart Simpson,He's just riding the thermals from Dad's butt.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, you passed the lumberyard."
0,Homer Simpson,"Dearly beloved. I'd like to open this service with the words of Emily Dickinson: ""Hope is the thing with feathers..."""
10,Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, I was great."
0,Homer Simpson,And then he said he didn't want a twin because they'd just fight.
11,Seymour Skinner,Classic wish-maker's mistake -- vague language.
3,Bart Simpson,"Over the lips and past the gums, look out dentures, here I come."
8,Ned Flanders,Look at that! Everyone's living it up except Ned.
3,Bart Simpson,Mooooom! Daaaaaad!
0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Underpants dinner!
3,Bart Simpson,"Exactly, come to the one you love."

0,Homer Simpson,"I would, but Marge would kill me... I mean ohh, right."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, the hell with her. Hester. Emil. Prudence. Lemuel. Increase. Dad."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, yeah."
1,Marge Simpson,"Maggie, you're coming home with me!"
10,Krusty the Clown,...and the husband says 'who paid you a nickel?' And the wife says 'Everybody'!
0,Homer Simpson,"Psh, that's no reason to block the TV."
1,Marge Simpson,Kids! Hurry up or you're going to miss your bus!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy."
0,Homer Simpson,OH MY GOD!
0,Homer Simpson,"Eh, I can't afford it."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, Bart, he's right. I did oversimplify."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thanks for listening, Dad."
3,Bart Simpson,What didn't I do.
1,Marge Simpson,"Yeah, right, that's what I meant, Lisa. State Un-fair."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, everybody, keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something. If we miss it, we're dead."

3,Bart Simpson,We're out of waffles.
0,Homer Simpson,That's right! Crawling on your knees!
0,Homer Simpson,"Bart, is that you?"
7,Chief Wiggum,Aha! I had a feeling we'd find you here!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,WE HAVEN'T HAD A CIRCUS FIRE IN MONTHS!
0,Homer Simpson,I told you to clean your room and instead you're watching chest videos! Look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal!
7,Chief Wiggum,Finally. Someone who knows what a traffic stop is really all about.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"If you put dog doo on the suction cups, they'll stick better."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Ooh, this game is gonna get some disapproving clucks. But for now I need my tongue to talk to you. I don't want to lose Edna, so I need you to sabotage her chances of winning tonight."
8,Ned Flanders,Greed!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Hello, Bart. Surprised to see me at sea level? Well, you can't bleed out your nose when your heart's broken."
1,Marge Simpson,What's that supposed to mean?
5,Lisa Simpson,Uch! The idea that you would compare yourself to Mahatma Gandhi...
1,Marge Simpson,I'd like to see the Japanese take on the club sandwich. I bet it's smaller and more efficient!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, stupid itchy church pants..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Hi, Little Vicki."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hi, Maude. Diddily. I've been having fun with my pal Homer. Diddily."

3,Bart Simpson,"Money, money. I need money!"
1,Marge Simpson,What's that billowing down the stairs? It's smoke!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, I'm standing in front of you."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Sure, I guess."
0,Homer Simpson,"Why don't we all pick the most ridiculous candidate, and write him in?"
0,Homer Simpson,No! You're wrong! Check again!
3,Bart Simpson,"Chief Knockahomer, let's win this one for Dad!"
3,Bart Simpson,How about the Clock Channel?
0,Homer Simpson,"One, two, three, tug!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Then we figured out we could park them in front of the TV. That's how I was raised, and I turned out TV."
5,Lisa Simpson,It's not the vegetarianism!
1,Marge Simpson,Maybe I should have taken a nice calligraphy class.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"-- by the time this paid political announcement is done, every Johnny Lunchpail in this whole stupid state will be eating out of my hand."
0,Homer Simpson,"No matter what I do, Marge yells at me. If she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's three A.M. Shouldn't you be baking?"
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, the stuff I stole from work!"
0,Homer Simpson,"But, I'll miss ""Sheriff Lobo."""
5,Lisa Simpson,I just want to tell you how proud I am that you're showing an interest in your fellow man.
0,Homer Simpson,Eh. Close enough.
1,Marge Simpson,Now this I like.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, son. Where have you been?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah. The old guy's a little love-starved."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Once. But by the time I got to a phone, my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kohoutek. I got back at him though. Him and that little boy of his. Anyway... that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me. Now, this morning we're gonna be mapping a small square of sky that's thought to be empty. It's my hope that it's not."
0,Homer Simpson,I hope they're goin' somewhere good.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, remember when the last administration decided to invest in our nation's children? Big mistake."
11,Seymour Skinner,Whom do we send now?
3,Bart Simpson,"What?! Without awards shows, how would I know what movie has the ""best beheading,"" or that ""Glee"" is a comedy?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Doesn't anybody in this town read?
3,Bart Simpson,You're my mother! How can you say that?
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw, c'mon, man. Admit it -- you knew this day would come."
1,Marge Simpson,"Any place is fun if you're there with ""Super Lips."""
0,Homer Simpson,"I've heard of these guys. You can wave your arms at 'em and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it."
1,Marge Simpson,Well this morning isn't a barrel of laughs.
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I've got an ace up my sleeve."
5,Lisa Simpson,"You? But... you're an intelligent person, Mom."
5,Lisa Simpson,"...Hitachee Tribe.,hitachee tribe,2"
0,Homer Simpson,"I wanted to, but your mother said kids might tease you."
3,Bart Simpson,E.T.
1,Marge Simpson,"When we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our Saturdays? Driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator motor?"
0,Homer Simpson,"So, how's that bowel obstruction doing?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Selma, I never realized you wanted a child so badly."
0,Homer Simpson,"They didn't have any aspirin, so I got you some cigarettes."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh no. Inside, the evil Bartron is a horrible mutant boy."
3,Bart Simpson,Ehhhh!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh no, there's that angry mob again."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm sorry. I got carried away. From now on the only thing I'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. But at least I made Lisa popular.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, and you've said that several times now."
3,Bart Simpson,And I've been wondering... not like I miss having my afternoons free or anything but... are you starting to feel better?
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, I have my secrets. Turn around."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey Homer, do you remember this voice?"
3,Bart Simpson,It's Lisa Kudrow.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey Crabby Hayes, get with the program!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Angry Dad's voice is part Walter Matthau... Hey, Felix!... part Little Richard Whoooo! ...and a little bit of Snoopy when he cries."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, I've earned their trust."
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, Bart, after me, you're the man around the house, and that means you're gonna have to help out with --"
0,Homer Simpson,"Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off."
1,Marge Simpson,You see that mirror? I discovered that if I sat in the kitchen I could see if the bathroom was free using the reflection from the mirror off the toaster.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Tell ya what, put on these costumes, go on the stage and mix in with the crowd scenes. He won't kill ya in front of all those witnesses."
3,Bart Simpson,A vacuuming robot!
3,Bart Simpson,"Yoink! Foiled again, freak!"
0,Homer Simpson,Did somebody say num num?
7,Chief Wiggum,"That's nice work, Ed."
3,Bart Simpson,It unraveled on a nail.
5,Lisa Simpson,I think it's wonderful. Mom and Dad side by side at the power plant. You'll be just like Marie and Pierre Curie.
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, can we at least keep the bikes?"
1,Marge Simpson,Lisa's door's unlocked!
3,Bart Simpson,Looks like you took a big number two.
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, boy. We'll get some grub. Even if we have to pay for it."
0,Homer Simpson,Everyone has a cellphone. Mine's at home.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, there's something I want to ask you. But I'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal."
0,Homer Simpson,I could kiss you.
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, Mr. Burns, how did you do that?"
0,Homer Simpson,I was having the most wonderful dream. I always wake up just before the good part.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Time for your holiday gift!
0,Homer Simpson,What do you want me to do?
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, it seems like if you really care for me, you should come forward."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait! If you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought."
0,Homer Simpson,"So long, chicken bone."
0,Homer Simpson,For now...
8,Ned Flanders,You know...
0,Homer Simpson,Everybody hates birds! ...Right!
0,Homer Simpson,"Aren't you proud of your big sister, Mr. Pinchy? Hmm? Hmm?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, you are the worst human being I have ever met."
0,Homer Simpson,"I had it all for one night. Now for the rest of my life I'll know what I'm missing. And all I have to remember it by is that my ears haven't popped. Well, I'll make sure that I never yawn again."
1,Marge Simpson,I'll just have a cup of coffee.
0,Homer Simpson,When you're older.
1,Marge Simpson,That's odd. Where's Homer? And Bart? And Lisa? And Grampa?
0,Homer Simpson,"Just the radio, dear."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, to work in your power plant?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Where'd it go?! Where'd it go?! Oh, it's in the cap."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No Dad, everyone's sick of that memory!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Good work, boy. Just for that, we're gonna treat your heart murmur, not just ""see how it goes."""
5,Lisa Simpson,"""Nirvana is achieved through right views and right speech... Positive actions lead to happiness and negative actions lead to unhappiness... No creator gods, just the pursuit of enlightenment..."""
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't worry Lisa, I've got the answer to your problems right here."
3,Bart Simpson,We got a rhyming dictionary.
8,Ned Flanders,Ned Flanders in Tinseltown?
9,Moe Szyslak,Keep talkin'.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, no?! Well, if Homer Simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then Homer Simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! That's..."
0,Homer Simpson,He better know how to keep his mouth shut.
11,Seymour Skinner,"You should never tell on a bully, Lisa. Everyone knows that."
0,Homer Simpson,Huh?... There have been so many classic Simpson moments. I remember that time I tried to jump over Springfield gorge...
1,Marge Simpson,It's so unfair -- I'm as handy as any man.
1,Marge Simpson,"I don't know. I should give Homer a chance... but on the other hand, I feel nothing for him."
0,Homer Simpson,"Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, you know, maybe he's right."
0,Homer Simpson,Wait a minute! Something's reflected in the lenses of Carl's sunglasses!
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, please. Why don't you just leave town?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Welcome back, Space Girl!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, Lisa?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, please. I'm too upset to talk about it."
1,Marge Simpson,The cemetery? And you're just sitting here?
7,Chief Wiggum,Keep those rose petals coming. I almost stepped on regular ground back there.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Now remember, these pools can be dangerous, so everyone pick a buddy."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Not yet. If I do, she'll never let me go to the boys' math class again."
0,Homer Simpson,"You know... I have no idea. Hey, Dad. What does the ""J"" stand for?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, shall we sing a hymn? Uh, ""Nearer My God to Thee"", maybe? Or, or, or ""Amazing Grace""?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Get out of here, you lousy... season!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Crowley's an ex-con?! Dear Lord, I've peed in front of him!"
3,Bart Simpson,A kid at school's gonna beat me up.
1,Marge Simpson,Just read the saga and see what it says.

0,Homer Simpson,"Kiddy Cork? ""Thumbstitute?"" ""AccuTeat?"" ""Bink 182?"""
0,Homer Simpson,The Internet? Is that thing still around?
3,Bart Simpson,Here you go. Enjoy.
5,Lisa Simpson,Here's an imaginary cell phone.
3,Bart Simpson,No thanks. I already helped myself.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, I think someone is saying hello."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Nah. I guess musical talent skips a generation... like diabetes. You might want to watch out for that, too."
1,Marge Simpson,Don't you have any sense of corporate responsibility?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh Michael, one bite of this soufflÃ© and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower."
0,Homer Simpson,I've gotta find milk somewhere!
3,Bart Simpson,Need a unit production manager?
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, fine. But I could do all kinds of stuff for you. I noticed that skylight in your bedroom's broken."
1,Marge Simpson,Bien.
1,Marge Simpson,"Mmmm. Goodbye, Ned. If the slightest thing goes wrong with that house, I want you to call me right away. Or you can beep me. In fact, why don't you just stay here tonight? We'll go to a hotel."
1,Marge Simpson,"I really need to concentrate on this, Lisa, would you mind--"
11,Seymour Skinner,Children! Stand down!
3,Bart Simpson,That's the only line I get in your stupid story?!
0,Homer Simpson,Great. That's great. But I have to get to work in the morning.
5,Lisa Simpson,"That's not true! First of all, Milhouse fell because you tripped him. Secondly, ""spaz"" is short for ""spastic diplegic,"" someone who suffers from a serious medical condition. Thirdly, your ""haw haw,"" through overuse, has lost its power."
1,Marge Simpson,Why does it have a picture of Vitamin Barn?
3,Bart Simpson,"Jeez, sorry. It's a pretty standard stunt, Homer."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that's it, Majesty. Notice I didn't say ""your."""
3,Bart Simpson,That's a guy with red hair.
0,Homer Simpson,"Eh, let my Dad enjoy 'em a little longer."
5,Lisa Simpson,It's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart.
0,Homer Simpson,"I know, I know you're not comfortable with all the guys Edna's seen around town."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,End communication.
1,Marge Simpson,"Everywhere I look, someone is breaking the law. Dog, no leash. Man littering. Horse not wearing diaper. Car parked across three handicapped spaces..."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, I have a very busy schedule, but..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Sweetie, you seem so blue. Did the last of something die?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes sir, I will notice that. Very casual, Mr. Scorpion."
1,Marge Simpson,...so I guess that may not count as anguish.
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, the people who lived here before, um, weren't always the best neighbors. But I love 'em. And, uh, you can't be a saint unless you live among the lepers. Hope you don't mind."
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, look at all the colors, man!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Wow, a Bob Mackie! ...Sorry, Bart."
0,Homer Simpson,Flanders? What are you doin' here?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, if this episode has taught us anything, it's that nothing works better than the status quo. Bart, you're promoted back to the fourth grade."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, don't worry about sports. I got that covered."
5,Lisa Simpson,"""Screamapillar Care Tips."" Wow, look at all this stuff. ""Without constant reassurance, it will die. It's sexually attracted to fire..."""
3,Bart Simpson,Cool! A ruckus!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Looks like we've got our first case ever, Skinny Boy. And this time, it's personal!"
0,Homer Simpson,And I counted the pennies in the ashtray.
3,Bart Simpson,Itchy The Lucky Mouse In: Manhattan Madness.
5,Lisa Simpson,And we don't even know whose gun that was. Maybe somebody planted it there to frame Dad.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Ah, a peaceful Saturday afternoon, with no Bart Simpson -- and no Milhouse, for that matter. Nothing on my agenda but to sit here and watch hummingbirds."
1,Marge Simpson,"Sorry, but I'm fighting for my man!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, am I?"
0,Homer Simpson,That's an odd way to start handing out medals.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Look at me. It's supposed to be my big triumph and I'm standing in mud, fightin' with geese. Well, if I'm gonna fight, I might as well win."
5,Lisa Simpson,Mom showed me how to make a retaining wall out of pillows. But I'm gonna conquer my fears... tonight.
3,Bart Simpson,Just go.
3,Bart Simpson,They hate each other.
5,Lisa Simpson,No! You lie! Eliza Simpson can't be a coward! She's the only decent ancestor I have.
1,Marge Simpson,My husband has our card...
1,Marge Simpson,It was healthy. He reciprocated. He reciprocated!
0,Homer Simpson,"No, really."
5,Lisa Simpson,I know! It's a complete violation of your rights. Not to mention--
5,Lisa Simpson,"He can't just eat peanuts, Dad. He needs plants to live."
1,Marge Simpson,BUT WHERE? I STILL DON'T KNOW!
0,Homer Simpson,"...I want you to find out what's making that funny noise in Homer Simpson's car. It's, uhhh, you know, it's like a chigga-chigga-chigga-chigga. But you only hear it when you're driving over thirty. And you never hear it when you take it to the shop."
3,Bart Simpson,"Sorry, Ralph."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer Simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our DVD player."
0,Homer Simpson,"Mr. Stomach, are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Now make with the pizza, Fatso. You're the stomach!"
0,Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. You were way off.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I just naturally assumed."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I can't go on! This rebuttal is a sham!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, Mr. Burns! Why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time."
0,Homer Simpson,"Log Cabin full of taste, my stomach is with thee. Blessed art thou among syrups and..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, relax. I'm sure it's just your brain going crazy."

3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, you're a hero!"
1,Marge Simpson,That Photoshopping freak!

9,Moe Szyslak,Ura Snotball?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Yes, I was drinking gasoline, Mother."

3,Bart Simpson,And Krusty's superfluous third nipple!
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I just think we should be building a nest egg."
0,Homer Simpson,"Keep your pants on, Marge.

5,Lisa Simpson,"Is he, Mom? You can tell me."

3,Bart Simpson,"I don't know why you're so energetic today, boy, but prepare to be worn out."
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, Dad, Lisa's the one you're not talking to."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?"
3,Bart Simpson,But I miss him. He was my best friend.
5,Lisa Simpson,MUST YOU BE FOREVER DIALING THAT PHONE?!!!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Okay, Dad's my hero. Why is he my hero?"
3,Bart Simpson,When do we get to see Krusty?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Really? Well, why didn't you say so? Let's roll!"
11,Seymour Skinner,... and while the school's only ball is being repaired...
0,Homer Simpson,That's it! Kids are the answer! I'll dedicate my life to my children.
3,Bart Simpson,'Bout what?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I can't stop thinking about her. Even these gates remind me of her braces.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, it wasn't me. It was Bart who..."
5,Lisa Simpson,I would gladly kneel -- were you the real king!
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego."
3,Bart Simpson,Wow. Praise from Caesar.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Noo! I'll never be this happy again.
0,Homer Simpson,"DOMO AREGATTO, MISTER ROBOTO..."
5,Lisa Simpson,I know. I already jumped to that conclusion.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, like all Americans, fast."
3,Bart Simpson,Uh... I can explain...
3,Bart Simpson,WHO'S THE BLACK PRIVATE DICK THAT'S THE SEX MACHINE TO ALL THE CHICKS?
0,Homer Simpson,"Let's see...cartilage, cartilage, muscle, nerve!... artery...bullet."
3,Bart Simpson,"Lis, you saved us!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've only got a hundred dollars. I'd better bid shrewdly."
1,Marge Simpson,I heard that!
6,Grampa Simpson,Forget it! I'd look pretty stupid in this outfit walkin' around fightin' oysters!
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, my own credit card! Thanks, ""Santos!"""
1,Marge Simpson,"Here you go, Homie."
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, is there something you want to tell us?"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Sayonara, Tojo!"
5,Lisa Simpson,It's true. I read it on a place mat at a restaurant.
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, I belong here! Pleeeaaase!"
3,Bart Simpson,Oh. My. God.
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, you had your fun. Now get lost."
0,Homer Simpson,"Walking distance, Marge. I've been looking forward to this all week!"
1,Marge Simpson,The pie was poisoned. You were right! I guess we've got to kill him before he kills us.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Why would you do that to me, after I thought about feedin' you?"
1,Marge Simpson,I don't want you reading those awful scandal sheets.
5,Lisa Simpson,GRIM--
0,Homer Simpson,I've gotta get out of here!
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but I usually have three or four."
0,Homer Simpson,Try the Flan De Leche De Cabra...
1,Marge Simpson,I'm afraid this time a coat of whitewash won't cover it.
3,Bart Simpson,How am I ever gonna get a cell phone?
6,Grampa Simpson,Junior Buckaroo 2nd Class. Little Grampa Simpson.
5,Lisa Simpson,You could make a great chef someday.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hey, hi, can I arrest any of you people for anything?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll get a second job. One that pays well. You think those guys on ""Friends"" need another friend?"
3,Bart Simpson,Why can't you do it?
3,Bart Simpson,Monorail! Monorail! Monorail!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Sorry, offer's expired. I guess we'll just have to let the jury decide, twelve good men and true. Good day. Smithers, release the hounds."
3,Bart Simpson,Get him outta here.
0,Homer Simpson,Femme.
3,Bart Simpson,I'm really sorry it wasn't a year.
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy."
0,Homer Simpson,Okay then.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Get that man's name. I predict big things for him down at the power plant.
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, I know you're gonna like your present."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Edna, we can tolerate mild alcoholism, leaving melted cheese in the microwave, even selling A's for cigarettes. But in laying a hand on a student, you have crossed a line."
3,Bart Simpson,"Cheer up, Toot-Toot. Have some of my ice cream."
5,Lisa Simpson,Mm-hmm.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, oh, man. Yeah, well, who's donatin' his body for that one? Huh?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Remember, your job and the future of your family hinges on your successful completion of Nuclear Physics 101."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Uh, he's not my friend. He's just a non-violent perp I'm gonna pound a few beers with. Is he looking at me right now?"
1,Marge Simpson,"They're all too old to be dressed up like super-people. Homer, let's just hurry up and go home so I can yell at you."
1,Marge Simpson,Bart! You're up early.
0,Homer Simpson,"If, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Boo-yeah!
0,Homer Simpson,Moe?! What are you doing here?
1,Marge Simpson,He's circling the Shelbyville Bird Sanctuary.
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, it's something, dear."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, I grunted way too early."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Hey, you got the keys!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Krusty, my man, you finally hit it big."
3,Bart Simpson,It's not Milhouse!
1,Marge Simpson,Artie Ziff! Why are you living in our attic?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Sir, we have to call off this bake sale, now!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Gosh, I thought he'd be happier in his true habitat."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Wow. What else did you do, Dad?"
3,Bart Simpson,The fly's stuck in Flanders' house!
0,Homer Simpson,"Look! Ree, ree. Ree, ree. Aye, aye. All right, all right, I won't take the dog. C'mere."
5,Lisa Simpson,"IF MAGGIE'S FUSSY, DON'T AVOID HER."
5,Lisa Simpson,"So, how was your first day of school?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"'Cause you ain't exactly Karen Allen yourself, you know."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, Dad, what do you want to talk about tonight?"
0,Homer Simpson,"So this guy might be my real father, and his name starts with ""M"". Moleman? Mr. Burns? M. Night Shyamalan? That would be a twist worthy of his increasingly lousy films!"
3,Bart Simpson,I'm sorry all right! Sorry I came back here!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Bobo!
1,Marge Simpson,I SAID STOP
6,Grampa Simpson,"That's right, I did the Iggy."
0,Homer Simpson,Eh-Eh-Eh.
0,Homer Simpson,Lousy Smarch weather.
10,Krusty the Clown,Now the babies.
0,Homer Simpson,"Barney, you ever notice how hard it is to drive with your knees?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I brought you some flowers! A full dozen this time! No tricks!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, we're having brunch with my sisters..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute... if she's going bird watching why did she leave our ""Peterson's Field Guide to Birds"" on the kitchen counter?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Baby, promise me you'll find out who turned me in!"
5,Lisa Simpson,That is so unsatisfying.
3,Bart Simpson,"May I be excused, Mom?"
0,Homer Simpson,More bread please.
5,Lisa Simpson,Grades are all I have. What could I be failing? I'm smart and a teacher's pet.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ahh, here's Dr. Gould now. What were the results, Professor?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Wait! Mom, I don't want you to see this."
0,Homer Simpson,"Nobody knows the band, Grand Funk? The wild shirtless lyrics of Mark Farner? The bong-rattling bass of Mel Schacher? The competent drumwork of Don Brewer? Oh, man."
0,Homer Simpson,"What? Well, I got news for you, Mister. You can't quit! You're cut! You too, Milhouse."
0,Homer Simpson,You wanna see how Davy Crockett really died at the Alamo? You must be 18.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hee hee hee. I've got your donut, Lard Lad! And what are you gonna do about it?"
5,Lisa Simpson,When my father was attending the moonshine competition last Saturday...
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Keep your eyes peeled for Injuns... I mean Native Americans. They're after us because we gave them those blankets infected with cooties.
3,Bart Simpson,"School? Oh my God, I've wasted the whole summer. There's so many things I still wanna do."
1,Marge Simpson,She's nice.
0,Homer Simpson,"Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?"
3,Bart Simpson,I'm listening...
1,Marge Simpson,"Stop it, you two, and put on some nice clothes. Since it's just the four of us tonight, we're having dinner at the Rusty Barnacle."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hi, Becky. Thanks for comin' out."
5,Lisa Simpson,"The unicorns are you and me, Dad. I drew it myself."
0,Homer Simpson,They wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Initially yes, but--"
11,Seymour Skinner,Because...?
0,Homer Simpson,Tour bus parked. Gotta save Marge!
5,Lisa Simpson,I don't know what Mom's thinking. This whole country club scene is so decadent...
3,Bart Simpson,I guess. Who are you?
5,Lisa Simpson,Wiggum!
5,Lisa Simpson,"There's the 10:50 from Newark... The 10:52 from Phoenix, connecting from Dallas... The 10:55 from Portland is running late. Again. There it is."
0,Homer Simpson,Bongo?! I told you never to ever talk about Bongo!
0,Homer Simpson,"Respect?! Nooo! It was me! I made the crank call. I do it all the time. Check with the FBI, I have a file. I HAVE A FIIIIILE."
0,Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Marge, they found a donor! I'm saved!"
1,Marge Simpson,"I don't know, but I'm sure it's spicy."
1,Marge Simpson,Really? How romantic?
5,Lisa Simpson,Then I guess you wouldn't mind eating one.
3,Bart Simpson,"So, anyway, can I, Mom? Can I take the job?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Megatronics Tip twenty: ""Make your cubicle into a you-bicle."""
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't call Satan! So what if the message wasn't a miracle? The answer isn't in syrup from God or a computer tablet, the answer is that the hope you felt was real."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, that's it. You are going down."
1,Marge Simpson,"Moe, this trip is about turning your life around."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello there, Flan-didly-danders."
1,Marge Simpson,"Whoops! There goes Carlsbad Caverns. Oh, well."
0,Homer Simpson,"Y'ello? No, I'm not coming into work. I have chicken pox. I know I said that last month, but I was lying."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I was watching. I saw the whole thing. First it started falling over. Then it fell over.
5,Lisa Simpson,'CAUSE CHRISTMAS EVE IS HERE!
0,Homer Simpson,My friends...
0,Homer Simpson,Go ahead -- just try to provoke me.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Man, I got a bad lawyer."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, we're drunk. Really drunk!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, that's great. G'night."
9,Moe Szyslak,It's our song.
5,Lisa Simpson,Point taken.
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm getting to that. So anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
3,Bart Simpson,"...since you get paid either way, would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass?"
3,Bart Simpson,"So we meet again, Mr. Bond."
0,Homer Simpson,I thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!
5,Lisa Simpson,Huh. It looks like he's praying...
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, at least I'll die the American way. In a foreign country wearing short pants."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, if you miss him, yell into a toilet."
0,Homer Simpson,Drunk!
0,Homer Simpson,Now calm down. I'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Got that Simpson?
0,Homer Simpson,"If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Look! Grampa's a gorilla, Sideshow Mel is Spiderman, and Nelson's a raccoon..."
11,Seymour Skinner,"All right, the battlefield is just a half mile ahead. Begin braking procedure!"
0,Homer Simpson,Steak?
1,Marge Simpson,No one.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Seriously, gimme the money."
0,Homer Simpson,"You know Marge, we're great parents!"
1,Marge Simpson,You can't have a brownie. Period.
6,Grampa Simpson,Fourth one from the bottom.
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa -- ordinarily, I'd say you should stand up for what you believe in, but you have been doing that an awful lot lately."
1,Marge Simpson,"Grampa, that's the commissioner of football!"
0,Homer Simpson,Andy Dick...
1,Marge Simpson,"So, Bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Excuse me, I have an emergency page from mother."
0,Homer Simpson,We're not keeping that moocher in this house another minute!
1,Marge Simpson,I hit it! I hit it!
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, at least some good came out of today."
0,Homer Simpson,Yentl? Whuzzat?
3,Bart Simpson,Why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding?
0,Homer Simpson,Okay. Open your eyes!
3,Bart Simpson,Let's see if they wore underwear back then.
5,Lisa Simpson,Where'd you get five bucks? I want five bucks.
3,Bart Simpson,"What Lisa's trying to say is... there's a new kids' barbershop in the mall, and we'd like to start going there."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,...So I foreclosed on her mortgage and took her cats!
1,Marge Simpson,I can't tell you how chagrinned we are about all of this.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, then quit badmouthing the house!"
5,Lisa Simpson,That is good because eating animals is wrong.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Well if that's Carl's home, then that's where our money is! And that's where we're going! We gotta pack!"
0,Homer Simpson,So... it cost you nothin'.
3,Bart Simpson,"Eh, shut your yap."
0,Homer Simpson,Sometimes. But the guy I really hate is your father.
3,Bart Simpson,Empty bottles... empty bottles...
0,Homer Simpson,Hoo!
1,Marge Simpson,"Stop it! No one was planned! Now, we have to pack for Great-Uncle Tyrone's birthday tomorrow. In Dayton!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Let's say this pepper got married to this salt shaker, and along comes sexy Mrs. Dash..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, at least I still look good."
0,Homer Simpson,"A song? Wait, it's coming back to me."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, those poor monkeys."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, want a thousand dollars?"
0,Homer Simpson,Of our marriage?! I don't want to live!
5,Lisa Simpson,You have a show?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Stop that! Stop that at once! You're fighting!
3,Bart Simpson,Hi. I'm Bart Simpson. I was incredibly moved by your reading. I don't think God's words have ever sounded so plausible.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Non-violence never solved anything! Fine, curtsy boy, I'll try it your way."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh-ho, no! This can't be happening! What the hell are we gonna do with ten thousand angel ashtrayyys?"
1,Marge Simpson,That wisenheimer windup toy could be anywhere.
3,Bart Simpson,"Put him down, boy! Put him down!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Eh, there's a picture of it on my cup."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Monday morning. Time to pay for your two days of debauchery, you hung-over drones."
9,Moe Szyslak,"I gotta admit, I-I'm kinda nervous, here. We haven't seen Barney since they enveloped him."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! Maggie, you're talking!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Time for a head count. Children, line up according to height... no, weight... no, the sum total of the letters in your last names if each letter is assigned a numeric value according to its place in the alphabet! Quickly now!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Eat justice, Sideshow Bob!"
0,Homer Simpson,You got that right
0,Homer Simpson,"Where's Marge?! That is so rude. I know, I'll hitchhike."
1,Marge Simpson,"Got it, music lessons!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"No, no one ever wants to hear about the importance of pants clips, do they?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, 'cause we're through with vegetables. From now on, I'm only eating food that I know had a soul."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, he's terrified of you."
3,Bart Simpson,Got it. Now what?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"The fight? Don't mind if I do. Oh, Simpson. Good news -- I brought some munchies. Smithers -- the Cheetos."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, if it isn't that stupid cop from TV."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Well, I dunno, are you man enough to test every one of your limits?"
3,Bart Simpson,I am the thing from Uranus!
5,Lisa Simpson,"How about ""Patty and Selma""?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Langdon Alger? Oh, I don't like him anymore... Okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially Bart."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oooh, look, Homer. The IRS."
1,Marge Simpson,Did you just drug me?
1,Marge Simpson,"There's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing. Look at me, I'm glowing!"
3,Bart Simpson,Wow! Look at all these toilets. And just inches from your bed. Talk about luxury.
0,Homer Simpson,"To overcome the spider's curse, simply quote a bible verse. Uh, thou shall not..."
0,Homer Simpson,"It's okay, Marge. It would have been a lot worse if I hadn't been carrying this Bible in my crotch."
1,Marge Simpson,"Three million, one hundred and--"
0,Homer Simpson,And a ooga-booga to you too.
3,Bart Simpson,And we'll stay up forever!
0,Homer Simpson,Where's the defibrillator?
3,Bart Simpson,The doctor did say surgery might help... but it costs seventy-eight thousand dollars!
6,Grampa Simpson,"I say we call Matlock. He'll find the culprit. It's probably that evil Gavin McCloud or George ""Goober"" Lindsey."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Cut the crap. ""I just collect the cans, Daddy."" Now grab yourself a beer and get me one, too."
0,Homer Simpson,"So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays. And they don't tell me where they go. It's like a conspiracy."
5,Lisa Simpson,How many more can there be?
5,Lisa Simpson,"What a beautiful night... fireflies, full moon..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"You know, Bart, just because Diggs is a little different doesn't mean he's not a good person."
3,Bart Simpson,You heard nothing!
7,Chief Wiggum,Let's tear this place apart!
5,Lisa Simpson,What kind of lunch is this? A drawing of a sandwich?
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round Buddha."
3,Bart Simpson,What if someone catches him?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, so extortion is the name of your little game, is it Simpson? Very well. Then you get nothing. I have the finest lawyers in Springfield, Simpson. Tangle with me and I'll crush you like a paper cup."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, Mr. Simpson, sir? Can you please change the radio station?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,That's a good thing!
1,Marge Simpson,Solar.
1,Marge Simpson,"Honey, the king of Mardi Gras has to ride around on a float all day. You'll be a sitting duck."
0,Homer Simpson,Watch me drive a golf ball off the bow!
3,Bart Simpson,"No, booze. First the easy part: kids, get some liquor."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I specifically requested no romantic music!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh?"
1,Marge Simpson,Parenting shouldn't have a style! Parenting is about bedtimes and passwords on computers and complicated punishments you never follow through on! Are you wearing a wallet chain?! You look like... a barista!
5,Lisa Simpson,This is how I always stand when I tell adults what they should be doing.
9,Moe Szyslak,"That is the stupidest story I ever heard, and I've read the entire Sweet Valley High series. Ha. I am sick of you drunks and your shaggy dog stories."
3,Bart Simpson,What the hell's that?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Wait a minute. If a second old geezer got shot, how come nobody reported it?"
8,Ned Flanders,"I learned that left is called ""port""!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, Homer, looks like we're boat buddies, huh? Want me to Zinc your sniffer?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. You just go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way."
0,Homer Simpson,"Comin' through... Hey, hi Otto... Sorry..."
0,Homer Simpson,"No, I do!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"And that's how I cured all disease, ended war, and reunited the entire cast of TV's ""Facts Of Life"", including long time hold-out, Tootie."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Nuh-uh, that's a vampire! But, uh, they're also covered. Carry on."
0,Homer Simpson,"Tell her ""no deal""."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. Don't hide behind a magazine."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Nothing much. Lewis made Richard laugh milk through his nose.
0,Homer Simpson,"Mmm, not bad."
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, I'm really glad you're still alive."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh, really? Prove it."
0,Homer Simpson,"All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football."
3,Bart Simpson,"If you don't race, then Nelson'll win!"
5,Lisa Simpson,No-no-no.
1,Marge Simpson,There is?
0,Homer Simpson,Adil! Oh... there you are.
9,Moe Szyslak,I did not think this through.
1,Marge Simpson,Now you be careful with Bart's undies.
0,Homer Simpson,"This little piggy went to Kwik-E-Mart, this little piggy went nuts, this little piggy went surfing, and this little piggy went--"
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, the old lady's apartment was actually Lenny's. We just used a different duvet cover."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh, Chief? Your boy's been kidnapped."
3,Bart Simpson,"That's the spirit. Now, what do you want to do?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, that stings Daddy's eyes, honey."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I was taking them to the groomer's.
0,Homer Simpson,"What's wrong, son?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Catch me, Flanders!"
0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoooooooooo--
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, Homer -- I'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow."
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, everyone! Now that I'm a teacher, I've sewed patches on my elbows."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hi. It seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. So if you'll have me, I would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization!"
3,Bart Simpson,"But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, ""A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right."""
3,Bart Simpson,That wasn't me and you're my alibi.
1,Marge Simpson,"Sure, we lied. We lied so we could spend a single night as a married couple without worrying about you kids!"
0,Homer Simpson,But I can't find you funny anymore.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, I see no way of settling this. I say we imprison them for the duration of our Bicentennial."
0,Homer Simpson,Gaa!
1,Marge Simpson,Of course not! I'm in bed with Homer!
1,Marge Simpson,You're alive!
8,Ned Flanders,Isn't she pretty?
0,Homer Simpson,"Scalping tickets to the Super Bowl. Have you no shame, sir? I should give you a royal caning."
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, the cake!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Sir, I demand satisfaction."
1,Marge Simpson,And the next man wants to hit the ball too. And he does. And there he goes off in that direction. And everyone is happy.
0,Homer Simpson,I say this boy needs more homework.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, methinks the lady doth protest too much!"
1,Marge Simpson,"None of those girls has had three kids, I can tell you that."
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, you kill them, I get rid of them. That's always been our deal. But I do have one question: do you want the head?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Marge, you know I thought I was Springfield's wing ding king, but uh, you make my chicken look like cock-a-diddily doo doo."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I am! Time to spread the word.
3,Bart Simpson,Why do you think everything's lame?
0,Homer Simpson,"Ladies, how're you doing with the float?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, hey! This is supposed to be a children's story!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
0,Homer Simpson,No. I don't want your pity or your money.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Quite impossible. I can try to bat him off if you like.
0,Homer Simpson,You the boss?
0,Homer Simpson,Your memory bubble and you.
6,Grampa Simpson,"You know, I was voted best kisser in my P.O.W. camp."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're so right. I guess I should be more concerned with Bart's safety than covering my own butt. And maybe I'm talking like this because I can't stop. Help me, Lisa! I have serious mental problems!"
9,Moe Szyslak,MONEY GETS YOU ONE MORE ROUND/ DRINK IT DOWN/ YA STUPID CLOWN/ MONEY GETS YOU ONE MORE ROUND/ THEN YOU'RE OUT ON YOUR ASS... WHOA!
5,Lisa Simpson,"There's one thing I still don't understand. When Bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, Homer."
1,Marge Simpson,Bart? Why are you doing that?
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, he was born with two noses and we hid him away till we could afford to cut one off."
1,Marge Simpson,Why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?
0,Homer Simpson,"See? Now wouldn't you love to see that move, performed by a cartoon possum?"
1,Marge Simpson,"I-Is this about that pen that I took from the Post Office? I-I swear I didn't know I put it in my purse. Then I was going to bring it back, but the dog chewed it up and that just made things worse..."
7,Chief Wiggum,"OW, I guess you are. That's what I like about this job. You learn stuff."
0,Homer Simpson,"Relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in Shelbyville."
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't get discouraged, Dad. Only four vertical miles to go."
1,Marge Simpson,But we know so little about them.
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't be a sap, Dad. These are just crappy knock-offs."
10,Krusty the Clown,Hey! This is all above-board!
1,Marge Simpson,"You are not pretending to be dead, young lady. This family has had nothing but bad luck when it comes to farce."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Forget it Bart -- it's so bright out, you can't see anything in the sky except the Fox satellite."
0,Homer Simpson,"Please, stop throwing fruit!"
6,Grampa Simpson,...and then a knife flew at my head! And you were there... And you were there...
1,Marge Simpson,There was a happy young family...
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, you've gotta take my picture in this car so I can show Milhouse!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I think Skinner might make a run for it -- he's eyeing the exits and doing calf stretches.
1,Marge Simpson,"...she's so helpful and everyone loves her and, well, this may sound crazy, but I think my family likes Becky more than me."
3,Bart Simpson,There's no time. We're going in!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Here's the book... ""Classics for Children?"""
0,Homer Simpson,"Why you little... No one's gonna beat ya, son. You're gonna get such a beating."
5,Lisa Simpson,"My one chance for everyone to like me, and I blew it."
5,Lisa Simpson,This party's boring. Everything here is for babies.
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll call you back, Marge."
7,Chief Wiggum,Maybe so. But Lou here says you were resisting arrest.
3,Bart Simpson,Nonhover.
1,Marge Simpson,"Ned, Homer and I are a little concerned with the way the school's being run."

3,Bart Simpson,I could take up smoking.
0,Homer Simpson,"I don't have a thousand bucks! But you do, don't you, Marge? You do... you do. You've been squirreling it away, haven't you? Saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? Right? Right?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery."
5,Lisa Simpson,"In his sleep deprived state, he's very suggestible. Okay Dad, you are now playing patty-cake with Maggie."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, you need an expensive couch to watch an expensive TV."
0,Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I'm gonna do something I shoulda done a long time ago."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Fat Tony, it's not important what other people think of you. What matters is how you feel, inside!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"But what if... I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking? Ooh, delightfully devilish, Seymour."
5,Lisa Simpson,"You're so smart, Chloe!"
9,Moe Szyslak,I didn't bring you back to life so you could make a fool of me at the club.
3,Bart Simpson,I've never acted on any of it!

1,Marge Simpson,Why are you singing that?
11,Seymour Skinner,And wine from their own grapes.
0,Homer Simpson,"It's the sound of a go-getter at work, Marge. Look, I installed a key hook so you'll always know where your keys are."
5,Lisa Simpson,"God, that was lame! Where did you get that?!"
6,Grampa Simpson,You've reached Abe!
0,Homer Simpson,And I'll make sure Flanders doesn't bother us.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, why did I lead you down here to find those stupid coins?"

0,Homer Simpson,"So, what's the problem, son?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Happy three in the morning, everyone! In a mere five hours, we'll be gazing at Springfield's most exciting glacier, Springfield Glacier. I hope you're all wearing glacier-appropriate clothing."
0,Homer Simpson,"I can't believe it! I'm actually running a marathon! Oh, I hit the wall! This is so painful! Hey, I got my second wind. Another wall! I ju-- Woo hoo! Third wind!"
5,Lisa Simpson,It says you can't bring in outside plants or animals. Any foreign creature you bring in could upset the environmental balance.
10,Krusty the Clown,That's it. No more autographs. I gotta go. They're naming a new sandwich after me at my restaurant.
5,Lisa Simpson,What happened to Mom?
3,Bart Simpson,Aunt Selma has one hour to live!
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, I knew you loved me boy! Now you can be my dog again."
0,Homer Simpson,"Chlorine, eh?"
0,Homer Simpson,I came to relax -- you think of it!
0,Homer Simpson,There was barbecue sauce on it.
0,Homer Simpson,"Dad, you and your stories... ""Bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""..."
8,Ned Flanders,"I... uh... I got your phone bill in my mail by mistake... and, uh... I'll just pay it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh my God! I know you must get this all the time, but can I suggest a flavor?"
0,Homer Simpson,Street cattle?
1,Marge Simpson,"Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Grandma Bouvier and Grampa!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes! The tag chafed my throat! Let's go eat some bugs."
0,Homer Simpson,How are they his treats if I paid for them?
0,Homer Simpson,"Sir, I studied under Ed McMahon!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay honey, we're almost to Palm Corners. There'll be nothing to do but lie on the beach and relax."
10,Krusty the Clown,"All I keep seein' is dead celebrities hawkin' products! They got poor Vincent Price floatin' around on a toilet cake tellin' me about the ""horrors"" of an unfresh bowl..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, great stuff. And the life lesson is?..."
6,Grampa Simpson,"It's true -- I've given up everything but raisins. And the doctor says they're killin' me. Sweet, plump coffin nails is what they are."
3,Bart Simpson,Wow -- Poochie came from another planet?
3,Bart Simpson,And I think I've finally found what I was put on this earth to do...
0,Homer Simpson,"The way I figure it, if the candy stays in the machine for more than a year, it's up for grabs."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thank you. Mm. For low-fat, this pudding's pretty good."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Here's another one. Knock-knock. Who's there? Juliet. Juliet who? Juliet so much pasta fazool, Romeo doesn't want her anymore."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Hmm. Yes, Colonel. Now, I understand it will be my duty to mold the new recruits into a well-disciplined, highly-trained infantry unit."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No Dad, I want you to play Homer Simpson."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Alright, let's just try one more lesson. Repeat after me: ""What flows from the nose does not go on the clothes."""
3,Bart Simpson,You're not a pushover.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Ex-cons are a Godsend to employers like me. If you ask for a raise, I just call your parole officer and back in the can you go!"
1,Marge Simpson,"It's supposed to say Jay's name, not yours."
0,Homer Simpson,I didn't lie. I was writing fiction with my mouth.
3,Bart Simpson,I said I want a divorce from my parents.
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, I get it. I'm not stupid. It's number two, right?"
1,Marge Simpson,Because it's so dilapidated.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hold on there! I'm countin' on that."
0,Homer Simpson,YYY... Y... Y... Y...
5,Lisa Simpson,She looks like she's crying.
0,Homer Simpson,Look at this place. Things have certainly changed since our ancestor Fievel came here.
3,Bart Simpson,She's lying! Slice her head off!
0,Homer Simpson,Lo-sers!
1,Marge Simpson,"Sweetheart, come to dinner."
1,Marge Simpson,"That's your hero. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""

5,Lisa Simpson,"No, Pie Man! Don't do it!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Miss Hoover, this beard's giving me a rash."
0,Homer Simpson,Are you covering me up?!
1,Marge Simpson,Why you big...
5,Lisa Simpson,Ssh.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog..."
0,Homer Simpson,"It's always something isn't it? First, I have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this."
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, Dad! I'm playing on a dangerous cliff -- because you're too busy arguing to pay attention to me!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Game's over, Grampa."
5,Lisa Simpson,Ooh! Here's a wonderful speaker! Geoff Jenkins!
9,Moe Szyslak,"I think I can provide that service. Um, uh, Chief Wiggum, could you hand me that little black book?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, who do you have to kill to get a place like this?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's see, I'll take his liver, a case of Adam's apples, that motorcycle man's moustache..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, you beautiful, beautiful wuss."
3,Bart Simpson,Slaughter house?
5,Lisa Simpson,Release the dragon!

5,Lisa Simpson,Just ask those guys for directions.
6,Grampa Simpson,Sorry. But you never said anything about comical exits!
0,Homer Simpson,"No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing."
9,Moe Szyslak,Sounds like you had a rough day.
5,Lisa Simpson,Season's Greetings.
1,Marge Simpson,Uh... hm...
5,Lisa Simpson,JUST HEAR THOSE SLEIGH BELLS JINGLING / RING-TING-TINGLING TOO...
0,Homer Simpson,"I tell ya, the kid's a wonder. He organized all the lawsuits against me into one class action."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Carl. It's World War II all over again -- America kicks Iceland's ass."
0,Homer Simpson,I stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh no! It's a real one! Noooooo! Why God, why?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Bart, my cargo pants indicate that I'm not here on school business. I'm here on ""cool"" business, i.e. curling."
0,Homer Simpson,Why you monster! And you have my daughter's saxophone too!
3,Bart Simpson,Where did you learn that?
9,Moe Szyslak,What a saga.

0,Homer Simpson,Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.
5,Lisa Simpson,Fifty big ones?

5,Lisa Simpson,"Get along, little buggies!"
0,Homer Simpson,What? Did you owe me some money?
1,Marge Simpson,The top of your head has a five o'clock shadow.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, why would you bring me here?! It's like bringing Richard Nixon to the Watergate! Or Kevin Costner to Waterworld!"

0,Homer Simpson,"Now, now, let's just look... there's Big Ben, there's Piccadilly Circus, there's Jimmy Page, one of the greatest thieves of American black music who ever walked the earth. Bup, there's the kids."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yo, Doctor S. Have you seen Milhouse?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I showed up for all your stupid interventions."

3,Bart Simpson,What you're saying is we've run out of fun things to do.
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, sir, how many times have you been blown up since the cameras went in?"
0,Homer Simpson,Miss work? But my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Exactly. All we ask is preferential treatment because of my fabulous wealth.
5,Lisa Simpson,Grampa! You have a job?
0,Homer Simpson,"Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind. I haven't felt this way since ""Funky Town."""
3,Bart Simpson,"Ah, I think I got your lunch."

0,Homer Simpson,A rocket ship wedding cake -- just what I always wanted!
1,Marge Simpson,I can't make that man beautiful. I'm just not good enough. I guess I'm no artist.
10,Krusty the Clown,And I don't? Is that what you're saying?
0,Homer Simpson,"My God, is she brave. Standing up to that freaked-out junkie."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well Bart, because of you, a horrible, yet innocent person is going to jail."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, I s'pose. Hey, you ever meet any mob guys? Are they really like ""The Sopranos""?"
3,Bart Simpson,"We had a story to go with this painting, but it was far too intense. So we just threw something together with vampires. Enjoy!"
0,Homer Simpson,"'Scuse me, pardon me, what the Hell?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Relax, they've got rodeo clowns."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hey, what have I told you about not using the numbers?!"

0,Homer Simpson,"That horse better win, or we're taking a trip to the glue factory and he won't get to come."
0,Homer Simpson,"MR. PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME. THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW. Our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, no. We're trying to conserve energy."
11,Seymour Skinner,This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. But I'm letting you go.
1,Marge Simpson,"You're like Geraldine Ferraro, except you won, where she failed miserably."
5,Lisa Simpson,I denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill! And I denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy!
0,Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I don't care what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt."
1,Marge Simpson,That voice could use a little personality.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, tell us your story. But it better have a beginning, a middle and an end. And you'd better make us root for the protagonist."
5,Lisa Simpson,But... but I'm very mature for my age. People often mistake me for nine.
1,Marge Simpson,Uh oh. Poonam and Uma are fighting!
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right boys, she's not letting go. Make the switch."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, the way I feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, if we didn't turn it down for the cops, what chance do you have? He hit her again."
3,Bart Simpson,"No, Stampy. No!"

0,Homer Simpson,Oh come on! Leave me alone! I'm trying to save your precious whales!
0,Homer Simpson,Life imitates Flart.
1,Marge Simpson,"Reverend, I hate to say this, but it sounded like that poor man was reaching out to you. I'm not sure your advice was all that helpful."
11,Seymour Skinner,"And special awards go to the two students who obviously had no help from their parents, Lisa Simpson and Ralph Wiggum."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Luckily I've prepared for this, so I'm not too worried."
0,Homer Simpson,"Echo, echo..."
0,Homer Simpson,Twenty million women in the world and I had to marry Jane Fonda.
5,Lisa Simpson,I got a chemistry set!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh, man. It's a miracle we got through that one. Remind me never to let you on stage again, kid. Some people got it, some people don't. And you, my young friend, do not have... hold on, I want to finish this thought outside..."
3,Bart Simpson,Ow! Mom! Lisa hit me!
1,Marge Simpson,No kennels!
0,Homer Simpson,Hey! Nobody cuts me off!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey guys, uh, you'll need this on your trip to Hawa--"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, little mouse, you are the only thing that keeps me sane."
1,Marge Simpson,"Colonel, we're here to discuss the terms of your surrender."
0,Homer Simpson,Very well. I'm not gonna be Angry Dad for one day longer. I'm giving up anger forever!
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, very."
0,Homer Simpson,No! No!
0,Homer Simpson,"I said someone like me, I didn't say me."
0,Homer Simpson,Bart?

1,Marge Simpson,You couldn't predict six o'clock at five thirty! Now good night!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I love you, Dumpster-bons."

0,Homer Simpson,You're lucky you're behind glass.
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, I can't! I can't eat any of them!"
0,Homer Simpson,Community service? But... that's work! What about jail?
3,Bart Simpson,"Didja hear that, Mom? She's as dumb as me!"

0,Homer Simpson,I'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, is the lady of the house in?"

5,Lisa Simpson,"Shut up! I just said ""shut up."" I'll punish myself by going upstairs."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooh, a Tiffany's box! And the thing inside is from Tiffany's! Homie, you've never done this before. How'd you afford it?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, no thanks."
3,Bart Simpson,"If I know my sister, and unfortunately I do, she probably ran off to some lame-o make-believe castle."
8,Ned Flanders,"Ah, yeah, I, I couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers."
3,Bart Simpson,"I don't get it, Lis. You said everything would be back to normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Maggie, look what's in your ear, a penny."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, briefly."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, who's the moptop with the big schnozz?"

1,Marge Simpson,"Oh. Well, yes, that's what I meant, too. Well, tell you what. This afternoon, I'll take you to the beauty parlor and show you just how lovely you can be."
3,Bart Simpson,"That sucked. Well, at least I've still got my health."
5,Lisa Simpson,Yeah. I've got some work to do.
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, Mom. I'll bust ya outta there just as soon as I get a cocktail dress and a crowbar."
0,Homer Simpson,"You mean, if I want pork chops -- even in the middle of the night -- your guy'll fry 'em up?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Missed, ya son-of-a-bitch!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?"
1,Marge Simpson,And Lisa will get a friend.
5,Lisa Simpson,But wait. How am I supposed to sleep with that spooky cemetery outside my window?
3,Bart Simpson,Hey Dad!
0,Homer Simpson,We hate opera!
1,Marge Simpson,"Which means, it's the start of Christmas season...which means..."
0,Homer Simpson,You ruin everything! /

1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer. Are you rounding up immigrants?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Thanks, but I don't really like soup."
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. Whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born."

11,Seymour Skinner,I don't agree to that.
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, fatty, out of the pipe!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Everyman is awesome! Reading it I escaped from my troubles! Now they're back in spades.

3,Bart Simpson,I'm not really about gum. But I like the whole chewing thing...
0,Homer Simpson,Drive to Chicago? I don't have time for that. I have to be back at work on Monday. And my boss is a total jerk.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hear me, people of the past!"
1,Marge Simpson,Someone poisoned these meatballs. Homer...?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes... that's the one. Smithers had thwarted my attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulance."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Remove the chocks, Simpson. Simpson?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Great debut, son. You really settled in after some early jitters."
0,Homer Simpson,Maybe a drink will help me with my driving.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hold on a minute. Governor, I've been using my powers of snitching for evil. But now I want to tattle for good. This prison is a hellhole. They feed us horse meat -- with traces of jockey meat!"

0,Homer Simpson,Marge's show!
1,Marge Simpson,"Fine, I'll do it!"
5,Lisa Simpson,... it's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code. It would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight.
11,Seymour Skinner,"I know it looks like the path to freedom, but one collapse and presto, you've got a snow casket."
5,Lisa Simpson,What do you care? You don't even like him.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I love to play, but I'm not very good. Also, I always forget to cash my chips back in for money."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, everyone out!"
0,Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter. I'm taking it pass-fail.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooo, that's quite a hug, honey..."
1,Marge Simpson,My baby boy is in jail! I'm the worst mom in the world.
0,Homer Simpson,"Those ""freaks,"" as you call them, are some of our closest friends."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, the combination of me leaving arts camp and you driving on and off the shoulder has made me a little ill."
0,Homer Simpson,"Listen Marge... I've been wondering all these years, what is it about me that you find so irresistible? Let's face it... you could do better."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Bart! They're testing me for lazy eye! Wanna come with?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Turn the page, Bart."
6,Grampa Simpson,I've driven hundreds of miles to say something very special to someone in this audience tonight.
3,Bart Simpson,"I know you are, but what am I?"
0,Homer Simpson,"No, ma'am."
7,Chief Wiggum,They're looting the mall. Hurry! I got nine shoe buffers!
0,Homer Simpson,And I promise I will return this RV first thing in the morning. Easy... easy... easy... easy...
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, I just had this crazy idea."
3,Bart Simpson,There's nothing to it. Give me those heels.
11,Seymour Skinner,"A half ton of newspaper and all we get is seventy-five cents? Huh, that won't even cover the gas I used to go to the store to buy the twine to tie up the bundles."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yep, I earned it."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oooh, right in the Panhandle! Write that down."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hm. ""Alice in Wonderland,"" huh? This must be a take-off on that ""Alice in Underpants"" movie I saw."
0,Homer Simpson,"I give you ""Botched Hibachi."" The tricycle is on loan from the Maggie Simpson collection."
9,Moe Szyslak,Huh. Maybe I should clear the air.
0,Homer Simpson,Can I help you with that?
0,Homer Simpson,I think I just might have what you're looking for.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Lady golfers? I thought we played this stupid game to get away from the women. With the yak, yak, yak and the spend, spend, spend! Am I right?"
0,Homer Simpson,Umm-hmmm...
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. I'll hunt down our friends who murdered you one by one."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Sweet dreams, Smokey."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ned, I had no choice. It was just so funny!"
1,Marge Simpson,That ad makes me look like a criminal.
1,Marge Simpson,"That's the problem. Even as we speak, millions of children are staring at the TV instead of getting some much-needed exercise. Those children's parents should be ashamed of themselves."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hi, Willie."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?"
3,Bart Simpson,You mean I passed?
11,Seymour Skinner,They never seem to like that analogy.
3,Bart Simpson,Thank God we've come to our senses and worship a carpenter who lived two thousand years ago.
3,Bart Simpson,Bosom!
1,Marge Simpson,"Ned, Edna... we just want to apologize for the commotion in your room..."
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah... Where are my pants?
0,Homer Simpson,Was it raining?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, your father's dead!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis! At least you nerds are still geekin' it up. What could be sweeter than a vacation that never ends?"
0,Homer Simpson,The US Festival! Geez! It was sponsored by that guy from Apple Computers.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Kent, not anything. It has to exist. Or does it?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Franklin Roosevelt bravely instituted a series of reforms called the New Deal...
9,Moe Szyslak,"Dammit, it fell apart like everything else I've ever believed in. Oh, I guess it's back to good old fashioned voodoo."
5,Lisa Simpson,That's the kind of riff you can aim for after years of practice. We start off with the fun stuff: music theory.
0,Homer Simpson,Run!
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Wait a minute, go back. Zoom in. Why is that man in pink?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome, all! Now to explain why I summoned you here."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, I'm outta money! Willie! You wanna buy my skateboard?"
6,Grampa Simpson,I first met Homer in 1927 in a bar in Brooklyn. Little did I know he would soon become Mrs. Joe DiMaggio.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Stop that, you want-wit! I might get stung by a bumbled-bee."
9,Moe Szyslak,Telephone.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that's great there, Ling Chow."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh God, my back..."
3,Bart Simpson,We're watching the TV.
3,Bart Simpson,"Turn on the TV, Lis."
0,Homer Simpson,"That's really sweet, honey."
5,Lisa Simpson,They made it back to the house?! How?!
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll miss you Pumpkins, but I just can't share your bleak world view. I've got too much to live for."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'm just as sad as you are. What happened to Grandma is an outrage."
3,Bart Simpson,Who's the new meat in my seat?
5,Lisa Simpson,"According to this book, the first thing we need is a setting."
3,Bart Simpson,But I will not be sharing my mini-fridge with Homer.
1,Marge Simpson,I guess. As long as we don't make it a habit.
0,Homer Simpson,"It's called ""headvertising."" It creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no I can't."
1,Marge Simpson,Switch stations!
1,Marge Simpson,I think so too. Bye!
3,Bart Simpson,"Stand aside, wussies."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Calm down there, 'Pu and She-Pu. You can use the restroom."
1,Marge Simpson,"Chloe, hi!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Warden, please. This man is a gentle soul. I know he's made mistakes, but someone with his talent belongs on a boardwalk doing caricatures. Not behind bars."
1,Marge Simpson,But we did win!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, uh, I was just leaving, but Moe... had an accident."
3,Bart Simpson,"Huh? Wait a minute, this doesn't look like Oslo. Where are the wood-stave churches? Historic Akershus Fortress?"
3,Bart Simpson,"The final challenge! Mousecatch... a game so lame, no one's ever finished it!"
6,Grampa Simpson,What a wing ding. This is much better than my girlfriend's birthday party.
0,Homer Simpson,I'll mutant you.
3,Bart Simpson,"No! No, I was talkin' to Lisa back there, we both agreed you killed."
0,Homer Simpson,The boot kicked Bart. It kicked him right in the butt.
3,Bart Simpson,"It's Grampa's smell. ""Old Old Spice."""
1,Marge Simpson,"Or, or, um, with, with a funny hat on."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Eh, that dummy doesn't scare me. I've had plenty of guys come after me and I've buried 'em all. Hobos, sea captains, Joey Bishop..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"That's very nice, Dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. However, I will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, hey!"
10,Krusty the Clown,Baaaahhhh!
1,Marge Simpson,"Yeah, you always do. Well, here's where to meet us..."
11,Seymour Skinner,...spreading the rumor that today's lunch would be served by a naked lady...
0,Homer Simpson,"So, I gotta know... do you guys forgive me?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"That's pretty good there, but don't expect me to bow and scrape. Well, I'll give you one scrape."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Skinned elbows?! All right -- time to score some pity!
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm a Buddhist.
0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm so glad to have my mom back! I never realized how much I missed her.
1,Marge Simpson,I was talking about--
0,Homer Simpson,"Do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!"
10,Krusty the Clown,Hey -- the Jewish Walk of Fame!
0,Homer Simpson,All gone. But in their place we have five hundred channels of television. All awesome. Sit down and I'll show you.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I want that man killed."
6,Grampa Simpson,I've suffered so long. Why can't I die?
11,Seymour Skinner,What are you laughing about?
11,Seymour Skinner,"It still points, doesn't it?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Ooh, twelve cents. I'll take eight!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Hey! What's he doin'? What's that sound?
0,Homer Simpson,Good ol' Dae Ho. Used to give me the pickles off his sandwich. And all I had to do was let him copy some keys.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, I'm not gonna accomplish anything just sitting here--"
3,Bart Simpson,You don't fight like a girl! Or even a Milhouse!
1,Marge Simpson,Baggy britches? Loose-laced gym shoes? Are you going to a rap performance?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, there's someone here to see you."
0,Homer Simpson,"But that's just under nine hundred dollars. I wish I could go seventeen thousand, but..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Dad. How was work?"
9,Moe Szyslak,Fine. Crap all over my theory.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, would you like a ""Thicker Than Waters"" collectible plate?"
5,Lisa Simpson,It's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up.
3,Bart Simpson,You were once the youngest of something?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Enough of your borax, Poindexter! A man's life is at stake! We need action!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, you did it! You landed a jet!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, it's time you got rid of that thing. All that candy is rotting your brain."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,It smells funny in there.
0,Homer Simpson,"Look at me, I'm a famous historian! Out of my way!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"That's okay, I was just thinking about Sybil Danning."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I like girls, Fruit Loop."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ah, Brazil. I couldn't stay afraid of you forever. The only thing that keeps me from living here is that fish that swims up your pee stream. That is a deal breaker."
0,Homer Simpson,Hey Marge -- what were your gambling losses last year?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, that was not very Christian of you."
1,Marge Simpson,"Wow, you can't find this stuff anywhere! Seals and Crofts, Pablo Cruise, Air Supply, Ohhhh, Loggins and Oates! And it's free!"
0,Homer Simpson,I gave it to Pepi.
0,Homer Simpson,Date with my wife.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Listen, you're a persistent fellow, but I--"
0,Homer Simpson,Stop shoving! The little one isn't getting any.
1,Marge Simpson,There must be a way to outsmart them.
7,Chief Wiggum,"You know what you did, Muntz. Burglary and arson. You're goin' away for a long time."
0,Homer Simpson,Wow. Wow. God does so much for me. And he doesn't ask anything in return.
3,Bart Simpson,"He's innocent, I tell you. Krusty would never do something like that. Ah come on Dad, you gotta listen to me."
0,Homer Simpson,"He's not talking, he's yelling!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I'll go outside and make snow angels.
5,Lisa Simpson,Look at all these monstrosities.
0,Homer Simpson,"""Honey roasted peanuts. Ingredients: salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings."" Mmmmm."
1,Marge Simpson,Uh-oh. He's getting that stabby look.
0,Homer Simpson,Shut up shut up shut up!
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't tell mama what mama don't like. Come here, you big lug!"
9,Moe Szyslak,Stop opening doors!
8,Ned Flanders,"All right, I'd like to call this meeting of the PTA to or-diddly-order and let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss, huh? Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna get there early, so I can get in good with the lunch truck guy."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"I can't be a baby anymore. I'm alone now. I have to be a man! Thanks, Mags."
3,Bart Simpson,Maybe I should go on anti-psychotic meds.
7,Chief Wiggum,"What's that, floating mask? Y-You want me to shoot everyone?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, mother, aren't you glad you didn't get more intimate with him?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?
0,Homer Simpson,"Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey sweetie, is Mom winning?"
0,Homer Simpson,How 'bout this one?
0,Homer Simpson,Wrong!
1,Marge Simpson,The answer is no.
0,Homer Simpson,Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name.
0,Homer Simpson,"Could you be any more...? Hel-lo! Look, just give me some ice cream."
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, I'm all for rescuing the kids, but I wish you hadn't sawed off my roof."
1,Marge Simpson,"Thanks for not killing me, Homie. Here's an extra pork chop."
8,Ned Flanders,"Dad, don't encourage him."
0,Homer Simpson,I'll mace you good!
5,Lisa Simpson,To make Bart a Krusketeer?
0,Homer Simpson,Real matuuure!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Jebediah Springfield was... Jebediah was... great. I, um, just wanted to say that I've done some research and, uh, he was great."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Who is that man, and why isn't his enthusiasm being punished?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, it's all my fault! I shook up that can of beer!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Well, I guess I could donate these costumes. They're from my Last Supper Pie Throwing sketch."
1,Marge Simpson,Was it Lurleen?
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm just examining what kind of person I am and whether I should destroy your happiness forever. Eh, why not?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Unbelievable! We're rewarding people for acting like buffoons!
0,Homer Simpson,Not a chance.
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, I know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
8,Ned Flanders,N-No... you see...
1,Marge Simpson,My husband by my side.
0,Homer Simpson,"C'mon, memory, wake up!"
3,Bart Simpson,My Confession by Bart Simpson. I am a regular dumb kid... period. I cheated on my intelligence test... period.
3,Bart Simpson,"Square as ""Golden Books,"" Pop."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Heh. Heh. Well, It's not like that's a crime."
6,Grampa Simpson,Now listen. All the drugs we want are right across the border. I have a friend who'll help us.
7,Chief Wiggum,I'll field that one. Me and the boys were all celebrating a job well done when I threw my match in the vicinity of the crime scene.
6,Grampa Simpson,Cross my fingers for me.
0,Homer Simpson,New shooter.
1,Marge Simpson,"No, I'm just fine right here."
1,Marge Simpson,"Welcome to ""Freeing the Artist Within."" Not literally, of course."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, everybody. It's the moment you've all been waiting for! The pig de rÃ©sistance!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, now look. My boss is gonna be at this picnic, so I want you to show your father some love and/or respect."
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, a friendly Springfield hello there, neighbors. I, you know, we think some kids of ours may be missing in your town."
5,Lisa Simpson,Why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
1,Marge Simpson,"I'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. But I never knew you were so good with hair."
8,Ned Flanders,"Uh-huh, but we'd love to have you on board."
0,Homer Simpson,That's almost a thousand dollars!
1,Marge Simpson,I'd stay away from poodles. They give the dog... ideas.
3,Bart Simpson,"Boy, Dad seems awfully happy."
0,Homer Simpson,"Thanks boy. Now, for the crowning touch..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Fractions aren't that hard, you just have to find a common denominator. For example: one half plus one third equals..."
0,Homer Simpson,Recording that fake fight was a great idea.
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, not really."
8,Ned Flanders,That's it. I'm losin' it. I'm losin' it!
9,Moe Szyslak,You will never work in the fast-food industry again.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Uh.
0,Homer Simpson,"Tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah Barn, you gotta unwrap the plastic before you smoke these."
7,Chief Wiggum,He didn't blow his line! Sarah! Let's have another!
1,Marge Simpson,"You don't need a Wii now that I'm here. Because you and me make ""us."""
1,Marge Simpson,"Just till you make it. Remember, I believe in you."
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, Homer. This isn't funny."
5,Lisa Simpson,Who'd want candy filled with laxatives?
3,Bart Simpson,"If I did it right, it's permanent."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well until that day, I'm still Bart's mother, and I don't like him stuffing himself with junk."
0,Homer Simpson,"I miss you guys so much. The smell of Marge's pork chops... the way you kids kiss my ""owies"" when I go boom... This place has become like a prison to me!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Ooop, I got him."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"But first, I'll daydream about a sport utility vehicle, a crispy chicken sandwich, and a wonderful blue pill."
0,Homer Simpson,"Beautiful music, baby."
3,Bart Simpson,We drove fifty miles to look at a stupid pile of vegetables?
0,Homer Simpson,"What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Excuse me, can I ask you a favor?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh, the Fourth of July. I can't believe that little boy in the pictures is you, Bart."
6,Grampa Simpson,I hear smoothin'!
0,Homer Simpson,Tell her the truth. You're not ready to get married.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you're not laughing."
0,Homer Simpson,We're going to break the bank at the Monty Burns Casino!
11,Seymour Skinner,"No, I have two identical sets of these clothes."
5,Lisa Simpson,What does a competitive eater eat?
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey Dad, did you color your hair too?"
1,Marge Simpson,I knew I shouldn't have put a fireplace in the bedroom.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Listen, Homer. I just want to take advantage of this opportunity to have you enjoy my saxophone with me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, what a gyp."
9,Moe Szyslak,Just what exactly is this good for?
10,Krusty the Clown,"C'mon, move it, you clowns!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"No, you can still turn back! The point of no return is the whispered huddle."
0,Homer Simpson,Hi sweetie. I'm off to Moe's. Love ya.
0,Homer Simpson,Look at all these helicopter parents. I hope Bart's doing okay on his own.
3,Bart Simpson,That was a miracle and it was gross. Cool.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey Barney, how 'bout a free beer?"
0,Homer Simpson,I gotta call Marge.
1,Marge Simpson,"Ned, are you checking up on me?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Posh. Shredded newspapers add much needed roughage and essential inks. Besides, you didn't notice the old gym mats."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh. Pretty, uh, freaky, huh?"
0,Homer Simpson,You stink!
0,Homer Simpson,What kind of bread?
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, I really did like hanging out with you."
3,Bart Simpson,I said heads up.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing."
7,Chief Wiggum,Here is a photo of the fugitive from our files.
0,Homer Simpson,"You know Chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"... Yes, Simpson."
11,Seymour Skinner,Steeeaam!
0,Homer Simpson,Hey Mr. Smithers!
1,Marge Simpson,What kind of hair?
3,Bart Simpson,I'm outta here!
0,Homer Simpson,Yes it's me!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Quiet, maybe I can get my citizenship."
3,Bart Simpson,Then why no pictures?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hmm, well, actually, it looks like we're in for forty years of wandering the desert."
6,Grampa Simpson,A stupid alcoholic hippo!
5,Lisa Simpson,We're buying a new doorbell?
1,Marge Simpson,See? All you need to get through a crisis is a little friendly conversation. Betcha the dads are doing the same thing!
0,Homer Simpson,I hope it's better than last year's lousy gift.
1,Marge Simpson,"Honey, I appreciate the thought, but just leave everything to me."
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh, what the heck. I know it's impolite to make a move till episode twenty-five of a Ken Burns documentary, but you're that special."
3,Bart Simpson,"C'mon, Milhouse. Do you wanna play in the NBA or not?"
3,Bart Simpson,"That's it, Lis. Now start crawling."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh my Juice Loosener's never gonna come.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Lisa, does this mean you like me?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Just a little dim, I guess."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, at least we won the bike."
6,Grampa Simpson,I didn't die in World War Two just to be pushed around by some pill-hoarding hussy. I'm gonna fight this thing!
0,Homer Simpson,Tethered?!
3,Bart Simpson,"It doesn't matter how you live or what you did wrong. As long as you're on TV, people will respect you."
1,Marge Simpson,What am I going to do? I'm down two employees and it's the afternoon rush!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?"
0,Homer Simpson,But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
3,Bart Simpson,Hi guys. Hi Otto. Move over. I'm driving.
0,Homer Simpson,Sherbet Hoover?
0,Homer Simpson,I guess I'll never find her.
5,Lisa Simpson,I think we might just make a good team. Like Maggie and Grampa.
5,Lisa Simpson,They want cheap sentiment? I'll pump 'em so full of sap they'll be blowing their nose with a pancake.
1,Marge Simpson,I was the only one without a date at Patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening!
3,Bart Simpson,Don't you have work?
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, I'm telling you, no matter who he says he is, he's really Sideshow Bob!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Reverend, I'm sorry to bother you at this hour but I threw a man out of my house today. I feel like I've violated Matthew 19:19."
8,Ned Flanders,"God's least favorite word, uttered on the public airwaves!"
0,Homer Simpson,Free? Uh...
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"A wedding is a complex thing, Bart -- it's so easy for something to go wrong."
0,Homer Simpson,Outta my way! She's gonna blow!
3,Bart Simpson,You mean Milhouse? Funny little guy. Afraid of the dark. And the light. Now I got new friends. Guys who get me.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I have to study for the Elementary School Achievement Test. And so do you."
11,Seymour Skinner,I'll bet your biggest hurdle was leaving your beloved hometown.
5,Lisa Simpson,Why does he think Alfred's friends with Batman?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Then for a long time, nothing happened. Until tonight. Behold the future of comedy: Poochie!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, she got to drink milk as a kid instead of white paint."
3,Bart Simpson,"But basically, Krabappel said you'd give the teachers everything they want."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I did. I was sure the guy was on the level because of his bad spelling and grammar."
1,Marge Simpson,Hip hip--
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh Bart, I knew one of these dumb things would work!"
0,Homer Simpson,Where's that spider?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, that's right. It's already happening, people. Hoard your toilet paper! Shoot the mailman! Shoot the mailman!"
3,Bart Simpson,Tantrum averted. But now I can't forget the cat.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,What are you talking about? This car is cooler than Guy Lombardo.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ah yes, ""Jerusalem Syndrome."" The name given to religious delusions or psychoses that occur when people visit Jerusalem."
0,Homer Simpson,How'd you get in here?
5,Lisa Simpson,Glaciers are nature's alarm clock...and it's time for us to wake up. Can there be any doubt that the culprit is greenhouse gas produced by man?
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah!
1,Marge Simpson,Wait. I'm remembering something...
0,Homer Simpson,Leave him to me.
8,Ned Flanders,Welcome to eternal darnation!
11,Seymour Skinner,Actually...
8,Ned Flanders,Howdilly-doodilly.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea."
3,Bart Simpson,You seem stressed.
3,Bart Simpson,"Sorry, Dad. Maybe now you'll appreciate us..."
5,Lisa Simpson,A homemaker! I might as well be dead!
10,Krusty the Clown,Where's the producer? I want to talk about this coffee.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Yeah, and the world needs a clown."
9,Moe Szyslak,"So something wasn't working in bed, huh?"
1,Marge Simpson,Somebody stop the fight! Where's the doctor?!
0,Homer Simpson,Sorry.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Until Mr. Roosevelt's New Deal starts working, this country's still in a depression. I'm spending a fortune on atoms, and we have to cut costs!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Okay, let me take figure skating."
0,Homer Simpson,Salamander awayyy!
5,Lisa Simpson,He also happens to be Toot-Toot's son.
3,Bart Simpson,That reminds me. I've gotta get over to Milhouse's and... uh... play sports.
8,Ned Flanders,Bullet-proof glass.
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't do it, Dad. Please don't do it."
5,Lisa Simpson,Wow! / Air show! / Cool! /
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Yah! Yah!
0,Homer Simpson,"Ah, come on, everybody. This bar is like a tavern to me."
5,Lisa Simpson,That's not right.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hmmm. Maybe if I stand next to the games looking sad, someone will feel sorry for me and buy me one."
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't you mean ""tough love?"""
6,Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, right. Good luck."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, okay, second closest."
0,Homer Simpson,No! My friends! Stop!
8,Ned Flanders,Well I didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.
3,Bart Simpson,Got it. How can I thank you?
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, I'm so sorry. I know I haven't been a perfect kid..."
0,Homer Simpson,Hey? Mountain Dew?!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, these grades are amazing! Just as good as mine!"
0,Homer Simpson,Hot tubs!
0,Homer Simpson,Oh... it's a special time in a boy's life when... Gotta go!
0,Homer Simpson,Ohh! Saxomophone.
1,Marge Simpson,IT'S A SHAME WHAT SCHOOL CAN DO.

5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you out-talked the talking heads!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, what about Bart?"

11,Seymour Skinner,Howwww old?
1,Marge Simpson,I never want you in this house again!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh Bart, I've missed you so much."
5,Lisa Simpson,It seems that most of the animals are sleeping.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge? I have an apology that I hope is better than all the other ones. So please listen carefully. The thing I liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love I received from obese children. It was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I think you might be developing a gambling problem."
5,Lisa Simpson,You should smell his room.
3,Bart Simpson,"Dude, I know. And I left a message with some guy named Hans."
0,Homer Simpson,"Quiet, you kids! If I hear one more word, Bart doesn't get to watch cartoons and Lisa doesn't get to go to college."
0,Homer Simpson,"Stupid ""Bart-toon""! Bart-toon, that's clever. I'm gonna kill him!"
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm trying to do something nice, you dink. Pick up a card."

3,Bart Simpson,"What are you talking about, Homer? Where are we going?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the big idea of getting trapped under that thing?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. It ain't stealin' if you take it fast."
3,Bart Simpson,Ow!!
0,Homer Simpson,"Fear not, m'lady! Captain Dash Superstud is here with his small tool!"
1,Marge Simpson,It's true. He does.
7,Chief Wiggum,FAREWELL...
3,Bart Simpson,Where's the beef? What the hell's that supposed to mean?
0,Homer Simpson,"YES, I STRUT DOWN THE BOULEVARD / BURNING OFF MY EXCESS LARD..."

3,Bart Simpson,"Hm, let me make a note of that."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ooh, a salute to brunch! Wave to brunch, Maggie!"
0,Homer Simpson,Because I'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?
8,Ned Flanders,"No, the lesson here is he's being punished for thinking women are beautiful."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, whatcha doin -- studyin'?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. I went to this bar the other night, and they..."
8,Ned Flanders,Church songs with clapping... I don't think this is what Martin Presbyluther had in mind when he founded our religion by sticking his Three Suggestions under the Pope's windshield wiper.
5,Lisa Simpson,What countries are those?
1,Marge Simpson,Kirk and Luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.
0,Homer Simpson,"You know son, my dad used to take me down to Johnson's Hardware. Old man Johnson knew everything about fixin' stuff. When they built this place, he hung himself."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Moe. Are we doing this again?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Let's go, Homer."
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, Lisa! It's 11 o'clock at night. Where do you think you're going?"
0,Homer Simpson,I've never been more awake in my life.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Let's see... What rhymes with ""Jebediah""?"
0,Homer Simpson,Whoa. That's a bit of a woo-hoo. Indeed.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Move your god darned house, Son!"
3,Bart Simpson,No way! They're finally having some fun!
5,Lisa Simpson,I know who Donald Trump is.
3,Bart Simpson,"Wait a minute, this game is educational!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, for the last time, I am not putting that in."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, guys. This is just what I needed."
0,Homer Simpson,"You know Marge, getting old is a terrible thing. I think the saddest day of my life is when I realized I could beat my dad at most things. And Bart experienced that at the age of four. So why are you still awake?"
1,Marge Simpson,Tell me later!
0,Homer Simpson,"Ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"You're fired, Lenny."
0,Homer Simpson,Sorry I'm late -- the Velvet Mafia made me a Margarita I couldn't refuse.
0,Homer Simpson,I meant the statue.
1,Marge Simpson,And unusual.
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver."
0,Homer Simpson,Hey! Don't Borgnine my sandwich.
5,Lisa Simpson,You like this?
5,Lisa Simpson,How did you find this place?
1,Marge Simpson,Deal.
0,Homer Simpson,"My daughter's at that Egyptian dealy right now. She wanted to take a limo, but I made her take the bus."
1,Marge Simpson,"Zack, you're not trying to help our marriage, you're trying to split us up! I'd rather have a chubby hubby than a sexy exy!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, you did. I remember your exact words. You said I should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house."
0,Homer Simpson,Un-sportsman-like conduct.
10,Krusty the Clown,No counterpoint! Vamp! Peppy!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, we're at war!"
3,Bart Simpson,Hey buddy.
0,Homer Simpson,"Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night."
8,Ned Flanders,"Marge, that dinner was a winner! What's for dessert?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, my first home run."
9,Moe Szyslak,"So Marge, uh... Homer's been gone a whole week, huh? In an unrelated matter, I just put on cologne and shaved my knuckles."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh I'm sorry. We should exchange insurance information. I have none.
10,Krusty the Clown,The Bolshoi's doin' the Nutcracker in my pants!
1,Marge Simpson,Well then maybe I need to give those kids a better example. Goodnight!
1,Marge Simpson,I'll get a couple glasses.
11,Seymour Skinner,Forgery. So he didn't have leprosy.
5,Lisa Simpson,What do we do now?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Up-up-up-up. Don't answer me now. Relax, talk it over with the missus, soak in the opulence of your surroundings and dream of what might be. Smithers, let's go powder my nose."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm pounding Melchizedeks!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Please don't leave me, George."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, are you ordering junk off the TV again?"
0,Homer Simpson,Can you drive me to Shelbyville Hospital?
3,Bart Simpson,Woo hoo! Mom finally stopped caring!
5,Lisa Simpson,"But when he's twenty-three, I'll be eighteen."
1,Marge Simpson,"Hello, Homie. How's my big important executive?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Then say yes to this raise, this promotion, and this flannel shirt which says ""I'm not screwing you over!"""
6,Grampa Simpson,See.
1,Marge Simpson,Is that the cat?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'd be lying if I said that this is how I pictured my wedding day... But you are how I pictured my husband."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, open my present! Open my present!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Evening, fellow rockers."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm sorry. I guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.
1,Marge Simpson,"Kids, today we have a very special guest -- my husband."
5,Lisa Simpson,Date?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, a doo dee doo doo to you, too, pint size!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, I didn't get where I am putting tops on things."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,They say we're contaminating the planet.
0,Homer Simpson,What the... you're a month behind on homework?!
0,Homer Simpson,And I'd like to thank Low Ball Construction for building this amazing wall... From ninety percent recycled materials.
0,Homer Simpson,Aha. There's some glue.
0,Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?"
3,Bart Simpson,What the hell's menopause?
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, TV and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson. From now on, I will stop being selfish and start being good. In fact, I'll be the nicest man in town."
3,Bart Simpson,I can't believe your dad gets paid to blow stuff up.
1,Marge Simpson,A chimp!
0,Homer Simpson,"What?! Marge, you have to."
11,Seymour Skinner,I'm sorry. Nelson never woke up.
0,Homer Simpson,Your mother thinks I'm working on the car!
1,Marge Simpson,"Beef salad, beef on the cob, beef-fried beef, uh... Is there anything on the menu that isn't meat?"
0,Homer Simpson,When are people going to learn -- Democracy doesn't work!
9,Moe Szyslak,You calling her repellant?
0,Homer Simpson,"Help us! Help us, for the love of God! Won't somebody help us?!"
1,Marge Simpson,"If I'm not having sex by the end of this goat-cheese quesadilla, I'm gonna scream."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,How dare you! I wrote a song for you! When am I ever going to use that again? Curse you and this morbidly obese little half-wit.
5,Lisa Simpson,Tracking software? You're spying on Bart!
3,Bart Simpson,"Very well, you leave me no choice."
0,Homer Simpson,And ca-lick!
5,Lisa Simpson,Ack!
0,Homer Simpson,"Take it easy, Marge. How 'bout if we dope you up real good?"
0,Homer Simpson,Wanna play some air hockey?
0,Homer Simpson,Parents Island?
1,Marge Simpson,"If you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture."

3,Bart Simpson,"Chill out dudes, it's me, Bart Simpson."
0,Homer Simpson,"Come here, people!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Now, no matter how much he hits you, you don't do nothin', okay? You don't wanna get drawn into a boxing match here."
5,Lisa Simpson,Me too...
0,Homer Simpson,What a week.
5,Lisa Simpson,It's so nice having everything back to normal.
0,Homer Simpson,"At your service, milady."
1,Marge Simpson,Be careful. We need that money to get home.
3,Bart Simpson,God bless that clown.
8,Ned Flanders,Whoa! Where's everyone going? What's wrong?
5,Lisa Simpson,"As the CEO of SpringFace, I want you all to have fun as you write source code until you fall asleep at your consoles."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I had to replace my beloved hounds with teacup poodles. It's pathetic. Watch. Release the hounds!
8,Ned Flanders,Heh. Sports on a Sunday? Hm. I'd better check with Reverend--
0,Homer Simpson,"No, no. This place is too expensive. I saw you doing a ""five-hundred piece"" jigsaw puzzle in there!"
3,Bart Simpson,Gotcha. I told you she liked mine better.
10,Krusty the Clown,I want to clear up a misconception about the Whatchamacarcass Sandwich. I used non-diseased meat from diseased animals. Everyone does it.
1,Marge Simpson,You've made that promise before.
0,Homer Simpson,"Leave me alone, you big bully."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, great. I'm stuck in this lousy tub for the rest of my life."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh my God. I know what the biggest ""ring"" in ""Springfield"" is. It's been right in front of us the whole time."
0,Homer Simpson,You don't have a doorknob.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, is there anything unusual in Grampa's coffee?"
9,Moe Szyslak,You told me to call. You wanted to see if your phone was workin'.
9,Moe Szyslak,Orange wedge?
1,Marge Simpson,"No, no, that's just our old Christmas decorations."
0,Homer Simpson,Don't pressure me. I get enough of that from my Dad.
3,Bart Simpson,I did it! He did it! We did it!
8,Ned Flanders,To: Online Christian Soldiers... Subject: Televised Super Swear...
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, I don't like this cootie platoon and I never will. I'm outta here and I'm out of this stupid outfit."
1,Marge Simpson,"You've got a big house, Ned. If you need extra money, why don't you rent out a room?"
7,Chief Wiggum,FIGHTING CRIME IS NOT MY CUP OF TEA...
1,Marge Simpson,"Ohh, you don't sound so good. We'd better get you some cold medicine."
0,Homer Simpson,"More snip, less lip."
3,Bart Simpson,I'M STUCK HERE TILL I CAN STEAL A CAR.
3,Bart Simpson,Who's gonna stop me?
0,Homer Simpson,Son-of-a!
3,Bart Simpson,Your Honor! May I say something?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, Andy Capp, you wife-beating drunk."
11,Seymour Skinner,He's a horrible excuse for an educator.
3,Bart Simpson,Too much raw bacon.
1,Marge Simpson,This is my husband Homer.
11,Seymour Skinner,There are no other Barts!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, don't worry. You'll get your three rounds!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, you can invite Milhouse. Lisa, you can bring a friend, too."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, speakin' of which, let's get these eggs back in a jar."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, Bart learned a lesson, and most important of all, we don't have to stop and pick up dinner."
9,Moe Szyslak,"So how about you, Barn? One wish?"
5,Lisa Simpson,It's Tom Wolfe! He uses more exclamation points than any other major American writer.
3,Bart Simpson,And that's why Flanders will never ever be my partner in crime again. Thanks for bailing me out.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh. You always gotta work blue, don't ya Marge?"
1,Marge Simpson,Give back the painting! The whole town's turned against us!
5,Lisa Simpson,"No it's not, dream-Hoover! And as long as I'm asleep, I'm gonna have some fun. I can fly! Wheeee!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw, geez!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hospital, eh? Wow, everyone's goin' there tonight."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, how come you never sang a song like that to me before?"
1,Marge Simpson,They seem to be building some sort of a shantytown.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm king of the bus station!
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, that sounds like fun!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, if I use my head, I can keep out of trouble. Better stay out of the sandbox... I could be buried alive... Maybe the slide..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't toy with me, woman."
1,Marge Simpson,"So... Pie Man, why don't you show me your superpowers? Pie Man?"
1,Marge Simpson,I'm what?!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Okay... thanks. That's very, uh... ""rad"" of you."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Do you have my teeff?
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, you've been driving in circles for twenty minutes."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ohh, I just swept the Circle of Death!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Now let's turn to the ever-unpopular ""Popularity Awards"" -- the awards voted by students, in judgment of their peers! No way that can go wrong! First up, Campus Clown..."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Now, please let me give you a wedgie in front of these guys."
0,Homer Simpson,"What the? But I thought bankruptcy was the cool law! The one that says ""Dude, don't worry about it. I got this."""
0,Homer Simpson,Heh-heh. Kids.
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, sweetie, I think your father would like to put your book up on the fridge where everyone can see how nice it is."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll take it from here, Fake-o."
5,Lisa Simpson,You've presented me with quite a conundrum.
5,Lisa Simpson,I can't believe you're gambling.
1,Marge Simpson,The kids are a mess! You brought them home exhausted and pretentious!
5,Lisa Simpson,I made it all up! There is no Hitachee tribe! I took the name from my microwave! But surely you can forgive a little girl who--
0,Homer Simpson,Our little boy has lost his mind. Let's get him.
3,Bart Simpson,"I love it, Max."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers! Run down to Sears Roebuck and get a five-eighths inch Phillips head bolt!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Take your time, dear."
0,Homer Simpson,I've seen drunker.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,But you four... you're the real heroes.
5,Lisa Simpson,What could've happened?
1,Marge Simpson,"Eu gostaria de um... hang on, hang on... placa de... hang on, hang on..."
0,Homer Simpson,Flanders? Kill me? You never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?
1,Marge Simpson,Tea? In the parlor?
3,Bart Simpson,"Better than all right, I got stitches."
5,Lisa Simpson,"And now, sports."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh is that so, young lady? Well, where is this phantom diorama?"
1,Marge Simpson,Stop it!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Actually, he feeds on more than just fear."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, you've gotta try it. This way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach. Then, BAM!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"But wait, wait, wait! What is this?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, why did I have to start my diet on pork chop night?"
0,Homer Simpson,Coming! I haven't forgotten about the sausage.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, you could treat me with a little respect."

5,Lisa Simpson,Hi. How are you?
0,Homer Simpson,"They should call this one ""recipe for murder."""
3,Bart Simpson,"I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner left, but now all I have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head."
0,Homer Simpson,"Eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie?"
11,Seymour Skinner,I don't have an appointment with any large men --
6,Grampa Simpson,Now to relax with a nice cup of tea.
3,Bart Simpson,"Maybe. But if Duncan wins the Derby, he can spend the rest of his days as a stud."
1,Marge Simpson,Woo-woo-woo-woo!
0,Homer Simpson,"You've got to set limits, Marge."
3,Bart Simpson,"No. No valentine for you, Nelson."

0,Homer Simpson,"Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back."
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, get out the Crayolas and color me tickled pink! Oh, what's with the lead pipe? Were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Uh, Bart?"
0,Homer Simpson,Sand... wich...
0,Homer Simpson,He's washing his hands.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thank you. I know this giant check is very important to everyone here. But, what's even more important is the truth."
5,Lisa Simpson,Ashley Grant! You gave a talk on women's issues at my school on how we don't have to be second class citizens.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ahh. Is this the life, or what?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Homer, you're... um... on the towel rack."
0,Homer Simpson,But we're the more powerful country for a few more years.
3,Bart Simpson,I was trying to breed the hamster with the lizard to create an unholy super-creature... when I saw an even worse crime against nature.
5,Lisa Simpson,No! Let's take the eagle to Shelbyville Animal Rescue. Where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.
0,Homer Simpson,It was me! You fell for it!
0,Homer Simpson,"Look at me, Bart! I'm driving!"
3,Bart Simpson,Hi yo!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey beavers! Remember me, you buck-toothed nerds?"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh son, you know how I love a good analogy."
5,Lisa Simpson,This is the place I've read about! Where Dr. Bushwell lives among the chimps!
0,Homer Simpson,Uh... she's small... she's a girl...
3,Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, quick!"
0,Homer Simpson,"It's okay, son. You'll do better next time."
0,Homer Simpson,"Say, is your butt numb from all this vibrating? Mine is. Still, I wouldn't describe it as unpleasant. Well, let's get some shut-eye."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait, you're not Bart! Eh, close enough."
0,Homer Simpson,How come you're not laughing? Do you think I'm slow?
0,Homer Simpson,That's just how I feel.
10,Krusty the Clown,"The French government wants to give me The Legion of Honor? Where do I receive this prestigious award? Izzy's Deli, one o'clock. Thank you, Monsieur President."
0,Homer Simpson,"Do I know what ""rhetorical"" means?!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Jenny, it's amazing what you've done with my son."
3,Bart Simpson,Bookstores don't have answers. They just have creepy guys sitting in easy chairs at the end of aisleways.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,The truth is... I'm dying.
0,Homer Simpson,You'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.
0,Homer Simpson,"I love you too, Jerry."
5,Lisa Simpson,I want to talk about a horrible practice afflicting millions of Americans. For years we've known how dangerous it is. It stunts your growth. And it's marketed to children. I'm talking about ballet.
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! How'd you get in here?
6,Grampa Simpson,This is what I call livin' in the past!
0,Homer Simpson,But don't take my word for it. Listen to this testimonial.
1,Marge Simpson,Have you been up all night eating cheese?
6,Grampa Simpson,"All right, we got what we came for, plus that stink rag to boot. Now, let's hit the road."
1,Marge Simpson,I think it means he's having a barbecue.
1,Marge Simpson,"Principal Skinner, I feel so bad for you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, when will Detroit build a sun roof for the husky gentleman?"
0,Homer Simpson,You! I should have known!
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm really sorry I hurt you. But I've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun I hid from you, the time I sued the church, ruining Lisa's wedding in the future... remember that?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Save us, Fun Dad!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, all I gotta do is take a quick ferry to Isla Verde, find CafÃ© Artiste, and they'll back up Kirk's story. That will prove the painting was his -- and now ours."
5,Lisa Simpson,Why is the zero made out of glass?
5,Lisa Simpson,This is where we're ditching the dog?
8,Ned Flanders,"Okay boys, this is it. The end of this sinful little suburb."
0,Homer Simpson,"A library selling books? If I don't want 'em for free, why would I want to pay for 'em?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Universal Studios?
1,Marge Simpson,You know what? I'll just cook this later.
8,Ned Flanders,It sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. Mind if I waggle my finger a little bit?
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, I don't care for the speed, but I can't get enough of that safety gear. Helmets, roll-bars, caution flags..."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Willie, please express yourself through mopping."
1,Marge Simpson,Sweetie... did you ever think of doing something a little more creative with your time?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, well, we really mean it."
3,Bart Simpson,That's not Krusty the Clown.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Look alive, boys. Coupla stewed prunes headed your way."
0,Homer Simpson,"Me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? Then I get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then I see the driver is a chicken?"
1,Marge Simpson,I think I might be able to turn this treehouse into a teahouse.
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, that's our ship!"
0,Homer Simpson,"I never thought I'd say this, but... Stupid Flanders."
0,Homer Simpson,"No, she's not."
1,Marge Simpson,Why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson! Put on your charm-their-pants-off pants! The mumpish oafs in Washington are sending their sternest band of nuclear regulators, handpicked to resist all blandishment."
7,Chief Wiggum,THIS IS THE END OF SKY POLICE...
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh, ah, c-c-could you sleep on my side? I-I'm trying to preserve Maude's indentation."
1,Marge Simpson,Who's a possum? You're a possum.
3,Bart Simpson,These rubes in robes haven't met the likes of Bart Simpson before.
7,Chief Wiggum,"So, what seems to be the problem?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Did I? Anyway, the Bloody Hangman set to his gory work. Bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"I know this is a fantasy, but I'll take it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh yes, I'd like... um... how do you say taco in Mexican?"
9,Moe Szyslak,Hey! He stole my bit!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, where does that tube go?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, Bart. I'll sweet-talk the Sheriff, while you grab his keys."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, everything's stolen nowadays. Why the fax machine is nothing but a waffle iron with a phone attached."
3,Bart Simpson,Say no more.
0,Homer Simpson,I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!
1,Marge Simpson,"Car, wake Grampa."
1,Marge Simpson,"Umm... Hello. My name is Marge Simpson and I painted this. Maybe you'd like to know what possessed me to do it. Well, I guess I wanted to show that beneath Mr. Burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain, there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of God's creatures."
0,Homer Simpson,"Bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside."
0,Homer Simpson,In the garage.
1,Marge Simpson,"Mmm, I don't think he's married, Homer."
10,Krusty the Clown,I didn't do it.
3,Bart Simpson,"He's dead, isn't he?"
0,Homer Simpson,I can't go on...
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Where's she going?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Willie? I hope I'm not being too personal, but you seem resigned to a life of abject squalor."
0,Homer Simpson,The truth is that I'm perfect and everything I touch is perfect!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh, my cheese, she stinks... no, wait! It's me!"
0,Homer Simpson,It's been a week already?
1,Marge Simpson,Uh-huh. Absolutely. / Yep. /
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oof. Well, he didn't put up much of a fight. Uh, why don't you pick one for me?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Sheriff Lowbrow...
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, this sucks!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, look at me! I'm Kim Basinger, the big movie star! I'm so beautiful! I think I'm so great! I'm too important to take Homer to the Oscars."
0,Homer Simpson,That's ridiculous. You do nothing but play God! And I think your octoparrot would agree.
5,Lisa Simpson,"If you don't believe me, look at this book I found."
0,Homer Simpson,"You're halfway home, lady."
0,Homer Simpson,How dare you torture my children with Mozart!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh my goodness! Homer, get her out of there!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy. Wanna toss the old --"
3,Bart Simpson,Medication?
3,Bart Simpson,That's a crud rock. It belongs in crud town.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I thought of a new thing -- it's called ""biking out."" It's a combination of biking and making out."
0,Homer Simpson,Even better -- a tale of ... One moment.
0,Homer Simpson,"Use as many big words as possible. I call ""computer."" Bart, you can have ""doorbell."""

0,Homer Simpson,I have come from my workshop in the North Pole to say: don't evict the Simpsons!
0,Homer Simpson,"Let's see here... caramels, waffle batter...liquid smoke..."
1,Marge Simpson,I don't know. All it takes is one troubled loner.
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, be that way. Be a big, stupid jerk."
1,Marge Simpson,And who do you love now?
3,Bart Simpson,"Krusty?! Doctor Hibbert, who was that man?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Wow, the Truth in Boardwalking Law has really done a number on this place."
1,Marge Simpson,"You are out of control! The late nights, the eating! You've actually outgrown your cape!"

0,Homer Simpson,"Book 'im, Lou."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Principal Skinner, as we both know, but you might need reminding, the annual bake sale provides ninety percent of the school's funding."

0,Homer Simpson,"OH, THERE'S SO MANY MEN AROUND THE WORLD, OF EVERY SHAPE AND SIZE / I WANT TO NIBBLE ON JAMAICAN JERKS AND TERIYAKI THIGHS..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Sweetie, don't worry. God wouldn't spring the Rapture on us unannounced. He'd send us signs, like, I don't know, all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving."
1,Marge Simpson,You've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.
0,Homer Simpson,No! I only learned that four days ago.

7,Chief Wiggum,"Yep, looks like she caught her own criminal. Unlike the rest of you lazybones."
0,Homer Simpson,"I put it in the bank. That place is great! On their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up."
1,Marge Simpson,You're not done. I want you to throw away these old calendars and TV Guides.

3,Bart Simpson,I'd rather follow the dog. I think he's up to something.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Don't worry Smithers, I'm putting you where the action is."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll work harder than ever before, and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined, lazy, and irresponsible! What happened to my bird?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Does it make you feel superior to tear down people's dreams?
0,Homer Simpson,"Will you kids pipe down! I'm trying to get ""Churro-Chaser"" to tell me where the freshest churros are. What country is Mexico in?"

0,Homer Simpson,I did a lick?
0,Homer Simpson,Correction. Free blood.
0,Homer Simpson,"""When the barbarian invaders came, the Carlsons met them with their weapons ready""..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, introduce me to this almond-eyed beauty, and all is forgiven."
1,Marge Simpson,Go easy on that -- it's gotta last 'til you're five.
8,Ned Flanders,Don't do it! Don't do it! You'll kill everyone!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Please believe me, I understand the problems of women... see?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Fake? Ridiculous! If professional wrestling were fake... that would make every fan in the history of the sport a complete and utter moron.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Death, you're a lifesaver!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well... as fabulous as your regulars are, a remodel might bring in a higher class of lush."
0,Homer Simpson,"So basically, my job is to make you look good by comparison. Like West Virginia does for Virginia."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm gonna put a spell on you! Yes I am, my tuna-breath familiar."
0,Homer Simpson,"Um, what do I do in case of fire?"
0,Homer Simpson,"It was years ago, when I was ten. Back in the '60s, or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s..."

11,Seymour Skinner,"Willie, go into the vent and get him."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh my Lord. Well, I don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell."
3,Bart Simpson,That's it. Looking good. Getting warm...
1,Marge Simpson,"Fine. ""Extremely Satisfied."""

2,C. Montgomery Burns,What in blazes? Who is that old geezer? And what has he done with Homer Simpson?
0,Homer Simpson,"Heh, heh, heh."
1,Marge Simpson,"Wait just a cotton-swabbing minute! A good man went to a lot of trouble just to impress you! And I went along with it, because I love him to pieces! And you made him look like a fool. Well, I don't want you anywhere near my house!"
0,Homer Simpson,"You got it, buddy."
8,Ned Flanders,"Hey, uh, careful, boys. That arch is lookin' a little Romanesque."
0,Homer Simpson,Who's out there?!

0,Homer Simpson,What'd you wear?

5,Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Bart. In your pre-Fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion."
0,Homer Simpson,"He what?! Flanders, landlords like you are the scum of the earth! You lounge around in your Egg MacMansions and we never see you unless the rent check's late!"
1,Marge Simpson,She's married to Buck Mitchell! I bet that's why she's here tonight honoring America!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, my God! She's having babies! Oh, I'm sorry, girl. I thought you were just getting fat."
1,Marge Simpson,"Eh, why do people worry about stuff?... it's all gonna work out."
3,Bart Simpson,"Wet cement! Is there any sweeter sign? Well, maybe ""High Voltage."""
1,Marge Simpson,"I never thought I'd say this to someone I cared for, much less my husband, but I'm saying it now: I don't want you here on Christmas."

5,Lisa Simpson,Forget it. I'm going home.
5,Lisa Simpson,Nancy Drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends. And I've got an inquisitive temperament! Maybe I could help solve this!
3,Bart Simpson,En garde!

3,Bart Simpson,"Uh maybe... uh, one more dish. Make it double cappuccino chocolate fudge."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, a bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it. I took in a movie. An appalling little piece of filth. Its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird."
0,Homer Simpson,"What happened to the guards?! Okay, okay. Don't panic. Maybe they'll tire themselves out with their chant."
1,Marge Simpson,Lisa! Why don't you come sing for us!

0,Homer Simpson,"Here's fifty bucks. For the next two hours, I don't want to know you exist."
1,Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, I notice little things about your father, too."

1,Marge Simpson,Can he swim?
10,Krusty the Clown,Who here likes nostalgia?
5,Lisa Simpson,We know you're the one behind this. So knock it off or we're going to the cops.

9,Moe Szyslak,Let the man speak!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh whatever, just take it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wha? Hey, you..."

6,Grampa Simpson,"I told you we don't have soft boiled eggs. If you -- ...By gum you're right, we should have 'em. I shouldn't be listening to complaints, I should be makin' 'em with you guys. The good Lord lets us grow old for a reason: to gain the wisdom to find fault with everything he's made!"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, I'm as tall as I ever was."
5,Lisa Simpson,Your minds are opening! Take it home!
1,Marge Simpson,Why don't you come inside and we'll talk?
0,Homer Simpson,Back cuts?
7,Chief Wiggum,"I hope you're not suggesting that I would take that necklace as a bribe. Think again, dirtbag! Because I can just swipe it later from the evidence locker."
5,Lisa Simpson,"What?! ""Least Popular?"" I gotta go."
0,Homer Simpson,The wrestler?
3,Bart Simpson,We thought this was gonna be a fun trip to the mall!
0,Homer Simpson,I've had my problems with sparklers.
5,Lisa Simpson,So Mom... You think you'll be getting out of there soon?
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, when you have a free night, we'd love to have you two over for dinner."
3,Bart Simpson,"Ne-e-ed, I'm ba-a-ack! Give me a ki-i-iss."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait, stop! We can outsmart those dolphins! Don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. I'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Y'know, Bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh angel, listen not to this child of Satan."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, I have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. If you can weasel me out of this physical, I will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. Amen. Now to mumble in a religious fashion. Dear God, oh, Lord oh God, oh, Lord..."
9,Moe Szyslak,The Salvation Army? You got it.
1,Marge Simpson,"Look, I'm really starting to worry. There's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere, we're all out of paperclips, and the curtains smell like doob!"

5,Lisa Simpson,"I was framed! You believe me, don't you Dad?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?"
5,Lisa Simpson,It must be exciting to make a different set of beds.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"You know, if we're partners, maybe you should do some of the work."
6,Grampa Simpson,Now everyone knows Homer loves his family...
1,Marge Simpson,No. I won't make a spectacle out of myself any further.
5,Lisa Simpson,Dad! I was telling the story.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Why'd you wake me? I was having the nicest dream. I dreamt I was the Queen of the Old West. I kept a six shooter in my garter, I did..."
8,Ned Flanders,I really hate to be a snitch.
5,Lisa Simpson,I got Bart's backpack.
1,Marge Simpson,"An ""A plus""! How did you do it?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Nelson's a troubled, lonely, sad little boy. He needs to be isolated from everyone."

0,Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. I remember falling in the mud, but I don't think that's why I've been screaming..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, I did marry her, but I abandoned her. Amber, tell her how I abandoned you."
1,Marge Simpson,That's odd. There isn't a single man in this whole bowling alley.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh my God, Homer! They're right next door!"
3,Bart Simpson,Come see me when you get out.
0,Homer Simpson,It still had eighty-eight percent of its charge!

5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, don't worry."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Laugh at the clowns' buffoonery!
0,Homer Simpson,And I'm not done yet. You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, I've placed marksmen on the roof to shoot the balloons one-by-one, but frankly, they're not very good."

0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, deal with it."
1,Marge Simpson,"He's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result."
1,Marge Simpson,Just what I always wanted.
0,Homer Simpson,I'd like to return this barbecue kit.
0,Homer Simpson,"No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance."
0,Homer Simpson,But I was really looking forward to...
0,Homer Simpson,You make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! And watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun!
0,Homer Simpson,Everything's right with the world.
0,Homer Simpson,He knows I love him. And he loves me.
3,Bart Simpson,"Think Bart, think! What was that lesson I learned from videogames? Oh yeah, kill, kill, kill!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, we're having a meeting."
7,Chief Wiggum,What's he in for?
8,Ned Flanders,... They'll fill your lives with...
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooh, you know what would zest up this hollandaise? A lemon!"
0,Homer Simpson,Woo Hoo! Woo hoo hoo hoo!
3,Bart Simpson,Can I cut a deal? I'll give you Milhouse.

1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, just tell them what they wanna hear!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Understood.
9,Moe Szyslak,Time to destroy your future.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, where's my dad?"
5,Lisa Simpson,I don't like this game! Nobody likes this game! Even the kids on the box look bored!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, please. You're the head of a major corporation."
11,Seymour Skinner,No team? I guess I just have to give you all an hour of free play.
0,Homer Simpson,DAMMIT!!
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, the ship's upside down and hundreds of people are dead!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry -- I'm ready for this. Bart, fetch ""The Defender."""

4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, Nelson. He's really hurt. I think he broke his leg."
5,Lisa Simpson,What percentage of prayers really come true?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Don't worry, I have a plan: pretend I agree with them."
5,Lisa Simpson,Can I have a lollipop?
3,Bart Simpson,It's really cool. You can point a red dot at people's crotches from really far away.
0,Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, are you here to forgive me?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Come on beautiful, I can't do the job without you, so what do you say?"

0,Homer Simpson,And I'll go skinny dipping in that lake where the sexy teens were killed a hundred years ago tonight.
0,Homer Simpson,Where is he going?

0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't stand seeing one of my children like this."
3,Bart Simpson,"There's nothing I can do to save my sister, the blimp or this airship."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I guess we can take a quick walk. We'll keep Grampa occupied with this DVD of Dwight Eisenhower talking about golf."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmm... reclusive millionaire, stately mansion, damaged psyche. He's just like me!"
1,Marge Simpson,"A pony? Oh, Lisa. You've asked for that for the last three years and I keep telling you Santa can't fit a pony into his sleigh. Can't you take a hint?"
0,Homer Simpson,Did you say Mary Pop--
0,Homer Simpson,Catch me if you can!
0,Homer Simpson,Last night?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh, yeah. I slaughtered the Special Olympics."

7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, all right, you guys can have Serena."
3,Bart Simpson,Hey Homer! You want to be the voice of Angry Dad?
1,Marge Simpson,"I hope he didn't cause too much trouble, Sheriff."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Hello, Simpson. I'm riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone. She was right to do it."

5,Lisa Simpson,How did you get that gash on your forehead?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Take a knee boys.

3,Bart Simpson,...Dad.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well Mother, I would like you to meet, Milhouse, Lewis, Richard and... Bart Simpson."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Not a one! Maybe the nicest was Abigail Simpson, who you know as the Pittsburgh Poisoner..."
7,Chief Wiggum,"It sure is. We're on the right track. Hey, what're you making now?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Thir-what year old?!! Lisa, you're only eight."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor."
0,Homer Simpson,"Homer Simpson here. I've sent the Sherpas home and I'm heading for the top, solo."

0,Homer Simpson,Where's your keys? I'm takin' your car to work.
3,Bart Simpson,"Just some report I gotta do for school. Hey, you want some pie?"
0,Homer Simpson,Nothing you can say will diminish this honor.
0,Homer Simpson,Like what?
1,Marge Simpson,Our anniversary!
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, tomorrow is the Annual Springfield Formal Event. We weren't going to go, after last year's... unpleasantness."
3,Bart Simpson,Not if I spend the whole time running around like this.
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, no. You want to make American kids work?"
1,Marge Simpson,Ring the bell!
0,Homer Simpson,You left a hole in my heart that could never be filled. So I filled it with food. But I'm never full.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, boy, wake up! Your old man found some deer!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Okay... best friend.
0,Homer Simpson,"Good for you, son. Giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. Have a dollar."
9,Moe Szyslak,"What? Nothing. She was hot. What, you can't take a compliment?"
8,Ned Flanders,"No, I got it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, no! I'm gonna go off the end of the --"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, they don't grow on trees."
1,Marge Simpson,"I hate to interrupt while you're rejoicing, but Maggie is terribly itchy."
8,Ned Flanders,"Gosh, fifty thousand dollars? I'm donating this whole check to ""Bibles for Belgians."""
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I'd like to see our self-styled Valentino tomorrow morning, Smithers."
0,Homer Simpson,"What are you, an animal?"
5,Lisa Simpson,How is that possible?
3,Bart Simpson,"And today, instead of buying comic books, I just read 'em and left 'em in the store."
1,Marge Simpson,"Can you help him, Doctor?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh God, oh God, I'm the smart parent."
8,Ned Flanders,"No, it's still where you buried it."
8,Ned Flanders,So what about all this meat?
3,Bart Simpson,Why would I want to?
0,Homer Simpson,That's right. Over the homes of poor people.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, I put this up recently, and it's a good thing I did, 'cause it really illustrates my point. Yep, good ol' Swigmore U."

5,Lisa Simpson,Ow! Someone just punched me in the face!
0,Homer Simpson,"C'mon, everybody, we're going to the Slaughterhouse!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Friend?
5,Lisa Simpson,It's just a cat.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Master Of The Atom.

0,Homer Simpson,I mean my little girl buddy.
0,Homer Simpson,Would a motel be okay?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Okay, Mr. Teeny. Before the cops come, swallow all these illegal pills, then run to the vet."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Here's what: you're off the team! Get him outta here, boys."

3,Bart Simpson,I'm catching a pass from Dan Marino! This is the greatest moment of my...
1,Marge Simpson,What's snuggling?

5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Mom. What're doing?/We were watching that!"
1,Marge Simpson,"What's wrong, sweetie?"
1,Marge Simpson,That means you'll have to be neutered.
1,Marge Simpson,Well here's another low-rated annual event -- Spring Cleaning!

5,Lisa Simpson,Tito Puente?
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, can't we stay one more day? The Occurrence and I are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey Lis, we learned so much scootin' around Vermont. Did you know that candles are made by losers?"

3,Bart Simpson,Hey! Why is it destroying other toys?

1,Marge Simpson,Nothing like un-tossing a leftover salad. It'll be like new!
0,Homer Simpson,I literally chewed the scenery.
3,Bart Simpson,"Jessica, you're really beautiful, but you are not very nice."
0,Homer Simpson,These are for you if you let me use your cherry picker.
0,Homer Simpson,How 'bout we take a family walk around the block?
6,Grampa Simpson,"If you ever travel back in time, don't step on anything, because even the tiniest change can alter the future in ways you can't imagine."

5,Lisa Simpson,Microatia? That's twelve thousand miles away.
3,Bart Simpson,I know a web site that shows monkeys doin' it.
5,Lisa Simpson,Mom! How did you know Maggie was here?
3,Bart Simpson,What kind of cheer-up talk is this?
5,Lisa Simpson,At Camp David? Sure. They couldn't keep pants on Kissinger.
1,Marge Simpson,Sleep tight.

8,Ned Flanders,It was right there... with the ... and the...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hurry, Dad, hurry!"
0,Homer Simpson,"What, dear?"

0,Homer Simpson,You remembered.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, I'm just being polite."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I'm supposed to be the responsible one. I shouldn't have let you let me get carried away."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh no, it's getting dark. Well, that's it. I'm getting out of this town alive if it kills me!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Big mistake, attacking me outside school hours and property! Legally, I can spank your bare bottoms!"
3,Bart Simpson,Finished?
1,Marge Simpson,"MY QUILT! Six generations, gone."
1,Marge Simpson,"If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, I know I haven't been the best Christian. In fact, when you're up there ""Blah, blah, blah-ing"" I'm usually doodling or mentally undressing the female parishioners... well, anyhoo... can I have forty-thousand dollars?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, no matter what the paper says, I still have a job to do."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I will not suffer your insubordination! There has been a shocking decline in the quality and quantity of your toadying, Waylon, and you will fall into line. Now."
0,Homer Simpson,A satellite dish!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Maybe it was, but according to my calculations, you're a great brother fifty-one percent of the time."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, you have such a beautiful voice..."
0,Homer Simpson,He's only your emotional uncle! I'm your real uncle!
3,Bart Simpson,Uh-uh.
10,Krusty the Clown,Oh yeah. Sorry I offered your life for my safety.
1,Marge Simpson,I wish this family was as close as the Flanders.
0,Homer Simpson,Uhh... can't you see I'm reading the uh...
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, Bart, you've gotta get outta here. Pack like you've never packed before. You know, I have never packed before."
3,Bart Simpson,Skinner? He works for me now.
0,Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? Prove it.
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, I told you not to get your lip disked."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, I'm a Buddhist!"
10,Krusty the Clown,I did everything!
0,Homer Simpson,Wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? Watching all the people come and go. You could have a different best friend every day.
0,Homer Simpson,Will you shut up? I can't hear the song in my head!
1,Marge Simpson,"I sent everyone I know an e-card for St. Patrick's Day... but not one person wrote me back! Maybe if I hit ""Refresh""..."
1,Marge Simpson,Win your own T-shirt!
3,Bart Simpson,Why do we have to go to the rec center? I wanna play with my friends!
0,Homer Simpson,Now all we needed was the approval of record company low-lifes.
1,Marge Simpson,"Any luck, Homie?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,May you all fly in an aero-plane someday.
0,Homer Simpson,I wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer 'do. How many husbands would do that for their wives?
0,Homer Simpson,"Bless you, bless you, how you doin'?"
8,Ned Flanders,I wish there was some other explanation for this. But there isn't. I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer!
0,Homer Simpson,Where's that cake now?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Well, kids, that's all the time we have for today."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Little help?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,You should be very proud of yourself. Sit down! Simpson! You're batting for Strawberry.
0,Homer Simpson,I thought she said polar bear.
3,Bart Simpson,Eat my short stories!
3,Bart Simpson,"Nuh-uh, 'cause we called it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, I am through spoiling you. First thing tomorrow you're going back to the rotten life you've always enjoyed."
0,Homer Simpson,What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, let me tell you the story of a great woman held back by a not-so-great husband."
3,Bart Simpson,"See? He's a questionable character! He used to hang around racetracks, you know!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thanks for making me take such a stupid risk, Dad."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, well I still love this place."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lenny and Carl suck. Please don't tell Lenny and Carl I said that, 'cause if I ever lost them as friends..."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, I knew we wouldn't win."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,You don't have a factory.
1,Marge Simpson,A library volunteer? Someone to Purell the CPR dummy?
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, somebody go first."
6,Grampa Simpson,It was your mother's job to name ya and love ya and such. I was mainly in it for the spanking.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ohh... Geez, I just wanted to escape."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, woa is me."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Big Daddy! What've you done with my boy, Daddy?"
3,Bart Simpson,Not that stupid stuffed lamb again. This isn't learning!
1,Marge Simpson,I'm getting worried about Lisa. She's been gone for hours.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,My eyebrows. My beautiful eyebrows!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Fine. You're ""Tellin' it like it is."" Also a crime now. And that one's gonna cost ya."
0,Homer Simpson,"Beautiful language, isn't it, Marge?"
7,Chief Wiggum,Fine. You got it.
1,Marge Simpson,Our kids just did something amazing!
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but after the ice cream man cut up his credit card, he got a little depressed."
3,Bart Simpson,"We got a runner. Snipers, take your shot."
0,Homer Simpson,Ohhh... get out of the corner!
0,Homer Simpson,"You're the guy who put wheels on luggage? Oh, bless you! Bless you!"
3,Bart Simpson,"...which I may have already spent, ironically, on these novelty eyeglasses."
0,Homer Simpson,British version was better.
1,Marge Simpson,Three!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, a talking toilet!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I still don't understand why you get to stay home and watch Mom work.
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, I'm going to get you..."
0,Homer Simpson,"No, not this one. ""The Smugglers of Pirate Cove."" It's about pirates."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"What makes a man endanger his job, and yes, even his life, by asking me for money?"
0,Homer Simpson,"You're leaving? Wait, what do I do here?"
0,Homer Simpson,Well that was a big bust... is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
0,Homer Simpson,How easy am I?
1,Marge Simpson,I should get some sleep...
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, Dad! Please don't pawn the TV!"
0,Homer Simpson,What's a cuckold?
1,Marge Simpson,"Selma, I've never seen you so happy. Giggling like a schoolgirl."
9,Moe Szyslak,"All right, they're on to us. Get him back to Sea World!"
3,Bart Simpson,So how's it supposed to work?
3,Bart Simpson,It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill our ants.
3,Bart Simpson,"Probably a scar, too."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, three bucks."
1,Marge Simpson,You still haven't told us why Lenny bit you.
0,Homer Simpson,"Guys, keep it down. I got some last words. I never told you this before, but sometimes when I'm at work, I think of you and smile. So often I think that ... oh, words won't do it. I love you, Moe."
0,Homer Simpson,That better not be the mutants.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, I can't wait to see which one of 'em dies first."
1,Marge Simpson,"This fat camp can save Bart's life -- we have to find a way to pay for it. Homer, maybe you could ask Mr. Burns for a raise."
0,Homer Simpson,Why couldn't it have been me?
5,Lisa Simpson,The biggest ring in Springfield...comes from the bell in the Springfield Bell Tower!
0,Homer Simpson,No way. I still haven't lost the weight I put on from the last one.
5,Lisa Simpson,"But it clearly says ""Feet Included."" They have to be here."
3,Bart Simpson,Dad! Knocking over a gravestone is bad luck!
1,Marge Simpson,"That's a very violent image, Lisa."
1,Marge Simpson,Why are all his laundry basket shots three point attempts?
1,Marge Simpson,Humph... where would an innocent child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet?
0,Homer Simpson,Tom Savini?
11,Seymour Skinner,Buying those extra trophies from cash-strapped schools really filled out the old case.
0,Homer Simpson,I can't believe you didn't invite me after I painted those cool stripes all over your car. I know! I'll throw my own barbecue - the greatest barbecue this town has ever seen! And I'll only invite who I want. That'll show ya.
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm auditioning for a play! It's a musical version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" Isn't that exciting?"
0,Homer Simpson,Why does he always bring up my weight?
11,Seymour Skinner,You're right. It's hopeless. No one has that kind of money.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"In these days of rising health care costs... blah blah blah... lip service, lip service... get out."
3,Bart Simpson,"There are no more great days, Bart. Just days."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Fiscal cliff.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no! They're due back at the store by six. Get off 'em! Get off, off! Get off!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Larry, please don't judge our whole family by Bart. He's the black sheep. Not that black sheep are in any way inferior to white sheep. I do not judge wool by its color -- only by how itchy it is. Ooh, look! Jazz!"
0,Homer Simpson,Piece of cake. All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
3,Bart Simpson,Can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, when is he gonna act like it?"
0,Homer Simpson,Note to self: edit out my lies.
0,Homer Simpson,Does this mean they'll never cancel the Jim Belushi Show?
1,Marge Simpson,Well at least it's a good place to see celebrities.
0,Homer Simpson,No! I can't get in trouble if I can't see you.
3,Bart Simpson,"I don't know, he's pretty sharp. He saw right through this disguise."
0,Homer Simpson,"Katharine Hepburn's ""Me""?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't fight it... That's it... That's it, a little more... How's that?"
0,Homer Simpson,"And that is that. Goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. Hello dream job in paradise."
1,Marge Simpson,Don't take Grampa's meds!
0,Homer Simpson,Stupid Marge tell me to shut up.
1,Marge Simpson,And white blood cells are attacking my clothes!
11,Seymour Skinner,Only to my job.
1,Marge Simpson,But it doesn't look safe. And the guy running it looks a little seedy. No offense.
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, thank you, you moldy old maid."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hi, Chester. Listen, would you pay to make more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Iiiiiii Waaaaaannt... That one.
1,Marge Simpson,Any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your Mom's done fitting in."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I know who you are. And here's something to help you never forget!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I was thinking amateurs only.
3,Bart Simpson,Cool! He tried to kill me!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Nothing evil. That's exactly the kind of radical thinking I need! It's a deal.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, I'm gonna get me the craziest, strippiest..."
6,Grampa Simpson,She's no hoochie. Her name is Zelda and she understands me.
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, you just take the kids home. I've got to return this keg."
0,Homer Simpson,I am not Krusty.
1,Marge Simpson,"That was so exciting, yet familiar. Like Coke with lemon."
5,Lisa Simpson,I didn't know we had a debate team.
3,Bart Simpson,I got expelled.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Ralph, you're also not a trophy."
0,Homer Simpson,It's the only worthwhile thing I ever made that wasn't Lisa.
0,Homer Simpson,I'm... a spare. Excuse me.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"""Thank you all so much. I love Springfield, from the cuddliest infant to th... ... puppies... patriotism... bluebirds..."" I'm not reading this drivel. This speech is over."
0,Homer Simpson,I said I've got it!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, the whole deal. Coffin. Tombstone. Anti-stink spray."
1,Marge Simpson,"I don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three."
0,Homer Simpson,And I do! Woo!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, uh... uh... Honey, you're just as smart as a man. Sometimes when I'm with you, I feel like I'm doing it with a dude."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hm... well, it's practically empty."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, anyone can miss Canada... all tucked away down there."
0,Homer Simpson,"You've gotta improvise, Lisa. Cloves, Tom Collins Mix, frozen pie crust."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, my little girl's just like CBS News."
3,Bart Simpson,My favorite song -- ruined!
0,Homer Simpson,But how?
9,Moe Szyslak,This dump is too filthy for a man with a positive worldview. I'm gonna start cleaning!
3,Bart Simpson,Nah. He doesn't want to learn and I don't want to teach him. We get along fine.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, it's a picture phone."
3,Bart Simpson,"Ruining your plan -- if you shoot me while we're in the same state, you go to jail."
0,Homer Simpson,Woo-hoo-hoo!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh I'll give you higher, my filthy little urchin."
3,Bart Simpson,"Forgive me, sir."
0,Homer Simpson,What the--? I'm not gonna gamble with my daughter's future.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Trust me, he'll say it, or I'll bust him down to Thursday night vespers."
3,Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Chief."
0,Homer Simpson,Good.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well -- and I can explain, remember -- I fill the balls with beer that I found at the dump, then I bowl them and some underground pipes take them into Moe's."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lousy, stupid Denver."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, dear."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I hope you don't mind a little walking.
3,Bart Simpson,You're not my Grampa.
1,Marge Simpson,THE SWEET LOVE STORY THAT IS OLDER THAN THE SEA...
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't worry. Whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow."
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, is that too spicy for you?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Man, what's gotten into you?"
1,Marge Simpson,"It's a healthy cereal from Europe: ""Meus-lix."""
3,Bart Simpson,Nothin's ever gonna stop me.
3,Bart Simpson,"No, no!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"That's even worse than ""I'm Dreaming of a Whitefish Christmas."""
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, hey, it's just a figure of speech."
1,Marge Simpson,"Haul away, driver man!"
10,Krusty the Clown,Loud? That's our secret word for the day!
0,Homer Simpson,She's with him.
3,Bart Simpson,Lenny Lenford. You're a long way from your barstool.
0,Homer Simpson,Bart's room.
5,Lisa Simpson,I thought you said you'd tell me about my true love?
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't be too loud and don't be too quiet. When you're too quiet, you get that psycho look."
0,Homer Simpson,"Quiet, Lisa. Everyone in the store is looking at you!"
5,Lisa Simpson,How else would you know?
6,Grampa Simpson,Where'd you learn that trick? In the Army?
0,Homer Simpson,That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?
0,Homer Simpson,"Gods, eh?"
3,Bart Simpson,"I know how you feel, Lis. No kid wants to outlive their pet."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,It's just like the other rooms.
0,Homer Simpson,That poor man. Is he okay?
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, that's a school for the blind."
11,Seymour Skinner,Welcome to Springfield Elementary's Next Top Model... building contest.
3,Bart Simpson,Why isn't my mom stopping this?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Now open the folder. It contains your next victim.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh yes, Lisa, very seriously. Whee."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, that's not it! A secret message this awkwardly-worded is always an anagram."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Comic Book Guy's secret stash!
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut..."
0,Homer Simpson,"I've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but I never thought I'd hear it from you."
5,Lisa Simpson,Let's go find your babies!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Permission... granted. Granted, Lou."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry, Apu. But remember, Who needs a Kwik-E-Mart--"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Dad, you can make it."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie. Look at that watch. I've always wanted a watch like that."
5,Lisa Simpson,Maybe you should let Dad read your book before you submit it to publishers.
3,Bart Simpson,"Helpful hint: if you want friends, don't use words like ""conundrum."""
6,Grampa Simpson,"You know, son, I believe it is."
0,Homer Simpson,Oooo! What a haul this year. I love Halloween.
3,Bart Simpson,"Correction, was your seat."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't the three of us go spit on the Principal's car?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Fine. You can confirm the accuracy of the hose.
0,Homer Simpson,That's insane! My dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. My gay dad is gay for gays.
5,Lisa Simpson,I've gotten better since this morning. How could that have happened?
3,Bart Simpson,"I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldn't get through my sock. Goodnight everybody."
0,Homer Simpson,That's the last time I trust the strangest people on earth.
1,Marge Simpson,"I can make her look any way I want -- let's see... hair: blue, shoes: sensible, body type: Olive Oyl."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Aw, God."
0,Homer Simpson,"Are you kidding? I'm stuck in that dead-end job again. The kids are gonna hate me cause I can't buy them all that stuff I promised 'em, and you're not gonna love me as much cause I'm ugly and bald."
5,Lisa Simpson,Well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Uh, me neither. But, but you know who does? Ralphie. Got a lot of worries, that kid: What if the bed wets him? What if Superman decided to kill everybody?"
0,Homer Simpson,I have many people to thank...
5,Lisa Simpson,"But if you can learn from Malibu Stacy's mistakes, so can everyone. I'm sure we can think of something together. C'mon!"
0,Homer Simpson,So that means I don't have to pay the fare.
5,Lisa Simpson,The radio lets me contribute directly to NPR.
1,Marge Simpson,"It's clever, just like you. Huh? Huh?"
3,Bart Simpson,He said he was going to work.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey elephant, I got one word for you: Columbo! No, that's not it. Modesto! Daktari?! Nintendo??!"
3,Bart Simpson,Can you paint me knocking out Larry Holmes?
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh. And ""if""?"
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm coming!
1,Marge Simpson,"But I fell in love with Homer Simpson. I don't want to snuggle with ""Max Power."""
0,Homer Simpson,"I see. Now, how do I prepare for the meeting with the Mayor?"
1,Marge Simpson,I'm toiling! What does it look like?
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey look, there's Copacabana beach. The heart and soul or Rio."
8,Ned Flanders,I sold it to you for seven cents.
0,Homer Simpson,Quick! You've got to hide me from PBS! Their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the Chubb Group!
3,Bart Simpson,"Whoa, mama!"
1,Marge Simpson,"See, Abe, we're still visiting you, even though we have no biological obligation."
1,Marge Simpson,How am I going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed?
0,Homer Simpson,Nuts to that. I'm going to the movies.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Moldilocks. Mom says I'm supposed to help you."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll show Grampa. I'll find my own surrogate father, full of heart-warming stories I can share with the world."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes I did! I heard ""competitive eater""!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, shut up! Always trying to act so mature... I'm glad you make the least money."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's just a suggested car size."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah that's right! Scatter, ya cockroaches!"
0,Homer Simpson,"I can too! ""There once was this guy from an island off the coast of Massachusetts... uh, Nantucket, I think it was. Anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh..."
0,Homer Simpson,"...groaning with a ""United Nations"" of donuts: jellies rubbing elbows with cream-filled, the masculine contours of the box juxtaposed with the feminine curves of the treats themselves..."
3,Bart Simpson,Cool. A dead hobo.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh my God. That's, that's shattering. And now, I'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy."
0,Homer Simpson,"All right. Wooo, what's that doohickey?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well uh I-I, was just saying that um...I thought it up all by myself."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"And so in the spirit of fence-mending and grudge-not-bearing, I hereby rename the Burns Germ Warfare Lab The Grandma Simpson Peace Museum and Kid-teractive Learnatorium."
11,Seymour Skinner,"It's a conversation starter! Lisa, this conversation is over. It's not you I'm trying to impress, it's Nelson. I know he likes the sleeveless look..."
0,Homer Simpson,What a deal! I'd be a sucker not to get it.
1,Marge Simpson,I wish you'd devote this much time and attention to our relationship.
1,Marge Simpson,"What happened to you, Homer? And what have you done to the car?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Great plan, Mom. But where is Lou gonna go?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, man!"
8,Ned Flanders,I just bought that...
5,Lisa Simpson,He must have dropped this.
11,Seymour Skinner,Start the bus Otto!! Start the bus!!
1,Marge Simpson,I've got a bad feeling about all of this.
8,Ned Flanders,Hi fellow Halloweenies! Did I scaredly-dare ya?
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's it. I'm gonna write you a ticket."
3,Bart Simpson,"In here, Mom. But don't open the--"
3,Bart Simpson,What makes you a hero?
3,Bart Simpson,"From the looks of it, a male dog."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots Vichy."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, it can be tough, but y'know I try to stay posit--"
1,Marge Simpson,I'll tell you what it means when it's over.
5,Lisa Simpson,Maybe you could take a class at Springfield Community College.
0,Homer Simpson,No kidding.
0,Homer Simpson,Thanks.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Those cabinet makers laughed at me, but they'll see."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that was uproarious. First-rate job, monkey!"
1,Marge Simpson,You've worked hard at the bowling alley. Why don't you ask for a raise?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"You must have a few tricks left up your sleeves. Smithers, boil some coffee. We're not licked yet."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, funny thing, that. You said the end was comin', so I sold the bar to some Japanese businessmen and gave the money to charity. Now them orphans got new skip ropes, and I end every day smelling like eel. Cats are all over me. Thank you, though. You did me a solid."
1,Marge Simpson,"We had a family meeting and decided that even though what you said about us was incredibly thoughtless and hurtful, you had a point."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, stop! According to this, it says Bart mixed up his DNA with a fly's. I think that's Bart!"
0,Homer Simpson,USA! USA!
0,Homer Simpson,Do do do do do...
5,Lisa Simpson,THEN ONE FOGGY CHRISTMAS EVE / SANTA CAME TO SAY...
11,Seymour Skinner,Now what is this all about?
8,Ned Flanders,There you go.
0,Homer Simpson,Third best for me.
3,Bart Simpson,I can't believe Krusty is really gone.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, we tried all those other tools."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Sarah, you're as lovely as the day I first arrested you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, congratulations."
0,Homer Simpson,One squeaking-spring symphony coming up.
0,Homer Simpson,Trucks are like big cars.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, these, aah, they're just painted on, there. Your choices are beer and, ah... egg soakin's."
0,Homer Simpson,I thought there was no crime in New York any more. Giulianiii!
1,Marge Simpson,"Could you cut it out, you two? Mommy needs some quiet right now."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Acclaimed? I oughtta replace it right now with that Chinese cartoon where the robots turn into, blingwads. But I'm a lazy, lazy man, Roger...So I'll give you one more chance. Now get out! Don't come back 'til you've fixed Itchy and Scratchy!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,What's good as new? Who's talking?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, we're gonna have to out smart him."
6,Grampa Simpson,"See here, sass mouth, you're not too big for me to tan your hide!"
0,Homer Simpson,Ohh... we're never gonna freak anybody out with this music. I brought something from my personal stash that'll blow some minds.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Ah, Spring Break in Hong Kong. Custom-made suits at slave-labor prices..."
0,Homer Simpson,You know everything about me!
1,Marge Simpson,Please just stay there till Bart graduates high school.
3,Bart Simpson,I can do that.
3,Bart Simpson,But the biggest heart I know is in my sister Lisa.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, if I don't have you to look up to, I don't have anyone."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hmmm, I'm not certain about Lenny."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,So the gem is inside you?
3,Bart Simpson,"Thank you, Ma'am. You've been most cooperative."
1,Marge Simpson,Either put that book down or let me drive.
0,Homer Simpson,You... let... go...
1,Marge Simpson,There'll be another one in North Yemen in 2027.
10,Krusty the Clown,Give that back! All I've got is a hole in my face!
0,Homer Simpson,"For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy!"
1,Marge Simpson,Putting away groceries -- it's like unwrapping presents from yourself. Fruit roll-ups for Bart... beer roll-ups for Homer...
7,Chief Wiggum,"Ahh, I got nothin'. How 'bout you, Frinky?"
3,Bart Simpson,That doesn't make any sense.
1,Marge Simpson,"Because I didn't want him finding out about the party. I mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring Sarah, and I just don't care for that woman."
3,Bart Simpson,"Boy, you sure taught me a lesson. Whew! Thanks guys. I guess now all that's left is a hearty handshake. Right guys?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, this job's fallin' apart! Everyone head for a different airport and we meet in Rio in a year with new faces!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh that's nice, but I don't approve of--"
1,Marge Simpson,Shh!!!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Okay, bye-bye / Bye / Bye, Grampa."
3,Bart Simpson,Fine and dandy?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Faster, Willie, faster!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Bart's got a problem!
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry I was inconsiderate, Milhouse. And furthermore, I respect you more for saying ""no."""
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah... well just talk about sports!
6,Grampa Simpson,Turn off that racket!
3,Bart Simpson,"Whoa. Thinking back, I'm kinda surprised Mom and Dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom."

4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I hate it too. Uh -- can I walk you home?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooo, how convenient."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, that sounds a lot like the movie ""Amadeus,"" which was historically inaccurate. Mozart worked hard on his music... Salieri was a respected composer..."

5,Lisa Simpson,The ones made from potatoes?
3,Bart Simpson,"Wait, Milhouse! Don't go! You're my best friend."
3,Bart Simpson,"But Milhouse! They haven't cured anything. Heart disease and world hunger are still rampant. Those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers. Every last one of them. Want results? You have to go to the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones, and, to a lesser extent, the Van Dammes."
0,Homer Simpson,Beefcake mags?

3,Bart Simpson,Did the goodnight pixie just kiss my cheek?
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, I'm gonna tighten Milhouse's straps. He's fidgeting again."

3,Bart Simpson,But I'm not Homer Simpson...
3,Bart Simpson,I gave him a caramel. He should have been chewing for hours!
0,Homer Simpson,Something's wrong with Bart. He's acting weird.

5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Tubby. Want another Pop-Tart, Tubby?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, I'm so impressed you're state champ."
0,Homer Simpson,That's him to a T!
3,Bart Simpson,Yahh!
0,Homer Simpson,The moron next door closed early!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Okay Bart, open your present. It's the one I'm most excited about."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, it's blue... six feet long..."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey Clinton, get back to work!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill. Everybody into the cellar!"
0,Homer Simpson,No problem. I'll just give her a sip of beer. Come on Maggie -- it's Miller time! Yes-it's-Mil-ler-time!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, isn't that awfully similar to the cootie patch you did last year?"
3,Bart Simpson,"After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way."
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't shush me, you rich bastards!"
0,Homer Simpson,I need that paper quick!
3,Bart Simpson,That's not where I buried them.
10,Krusty the Clown,"You know, Joe. Yours is the only show I'll do..."
5,Lisa Simpson,How veiled?
1,Marge Simpson,"No, I'm kind of embarrassed about it."
1,Marge Simpson,"Uh, I'm thinking of getting Maggie swimming lessons."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Aw, we're gonna die and I never tasted canteloupe."
1,Marge Simpson,"I was thinking mantle, too! Talk about being on the same wavelength."
1,Marge Simpson,A teacher can't be a bully.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmmm. Who is that lavatory linksman, Smithers?"
3,Bart Simpson,"That's not fair, Nelson. They didn't have the Killmatic 3,000 back then."
0,Homer Simpson,"Come on, boy."
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, let's take that..."
0,Homer Simpson,Shut up boy. If they make this field goal I win fifty bucks.
0,Homer Simpson,The kid's gotta die.
5,Lisa Simpson,...and you've got the elderly Jewish couple making their first trip to Israel.
5,Lisa Simpson,"And now without further ado, I give you... this!!!"
9,Moe Szyslak,Yeah! Do that!
1,Marge Simpson,But we don't have a sitter for Maggie.

0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, what the--"
3,Bart Simpson,France? Wow.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hasta la vista, Abie."
1,Marge Simpson,"Forget it, Marge. A girl like you could never land a Homer Simpson."

0,Homer Simpson,Mine too. Just like back in that hay loft.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey Milhouse, guess where I'm calling from?"
0,Homer Simpson,Look out! It's the Grumple!

3,Bart Simpson,Then go back to Jimbo and show him every boob you've got.
0,Homer Simpson,And it sucked!
1,Marge Simpson,There is no Mrs. Steak. Who could stay married to such a man.
3,Bart Simpson,"And, cue snow."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, thanks. Do you have any fruit?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm glad your side of the deal worked out."
0,Homer Simpson,Such a peaceful end.
0,Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. This is today's paper. That meeting is tonight!
0,Homer Simpson,And he never even lived to be a vegetable.
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, video games sure have changed since I was a kid. How many points does it take to get an extra life these days, son? Thirty thousand? Certainly not fifty."
1,Marge Simpson,"Please, Bart, no more pranks. It would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo."
0,Homer Simpson,"Fine. I'll swab whatever you say. Look, I'm swabbing the deck. I'm swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of. Oh! I'm swabbing the top of the ocean."
0,Homer Simpson,Auugghh!
0,Homer Simpson,"I say, I say... my groin!"
0,Homer Simpson,Look at all these knobs and buttons. They are clearly a superior race. But maybe that means they'll be nice to us.

0,Homer Simpson,And you won't... unless you can leap through fire!
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, Captain Rush-Rush, out of the car."

8,Ned Flanders,"Well, Diane, I've sure enjoyed chatting with you about your problems with your mother."
0,Homer Simpson,There's Bugs Bunny... Fat Elvis... Autumn in New England... Bats of the Southwest... all heroes. Wanna see Elvis kiss a bat? Hey baby come here lemme kiss you...
0,Homer Simpson,That's it! I'm calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.
1,Marge Simpson,How could you kill your own mother?
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh, I-I guess you'd rather see a film about a liberal European wizard school, or the latest sexcapade of Miss Ashley Judd!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ah! Well, if you kids believe in me that much, I'll give it my best shot."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, the Simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, there's nothing more pathetic than self-delusion, eh."
0,Homer Simpson,This better be good.
5,Lisa Simpson,"But Dad, you don't need to help me by humiliating people."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, Moe..."
0,Homer Simpson,When I'm done with my robo-botomies.
1,Marge Simpson,"Thank you, honey. They come in a squeeze bottle now."

1,Marge Simpson,"Well at least it didn't end as bad as ""Romeo and Juliet."""
3,Bart Simpson,Hey! Leave him alone. I too know the pain of hand-me-down underwear.
1,Marge Simpson,"Listen, Mr. Hobo. You may not have laundry to wash, but I do. Now what do you want to show me?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, I need to housebreak our new police dog. Plus, it couldn't hurt Ralphie to brush up on the fundamentals."
3,Bart Simpson,"Sorry, no can do. I'm taking off for six months to join the Skewed Tour."
0,Homer Simpson,"Relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. Enjoy your day at the beach! Ooh, look."
1,Marge Simpson,Then to save us... we need something incredibly unnatural!
5,Lisa Simpson,Can I weld that?
0,Homer Simpson,"Tickets, thirty dollars! Big game, everyone wants to see the game..."
0,Homer Simpson,"From now on, my only ambition is to be the world's greatest Dad."
3,Bart Simpson,Where did the ship stop again?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, here are the responses from the colleges you applied to."
0,Homer Simpson,Hey Flanders! Look what I got!
5,Lisa Simpson,Never mind. Looks like the Flanders' are gonna get those seats anyway.
1,Marge Simpson,I have a favor to ask: please shut this place down and move away from Springfield.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Whooaa.
3,Bart Simpson,"All right, snow day! No school tomorrow!"
0,Homer Simpson,That can be arranged.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, any friend of Marge is a friend of mine."
0,Homer Simpson,"Why, you little..."
10,Krusty the Clown,Wha? What'd I do?
7,Chief Wiggum,"That's the spirit, Bonesy. Why don't you sing a song for the nice people?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"They're so beautiful. And their breath smells like peppermint! No! No! I won't take your blood ponies! Go on, sweetie. Go on. Shoo!"
0,Homer Simpson,I think it was when that cold snap killed off all the hoboes.
0,Homer Simpson,And I also mixed all the spices together into one super spice!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, he knows how to push all my buttons."
5,Lisa Simpson,This school has everything.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad, gimme fifty bucks. I gotta buy some things. Uh, better make it a hundred."
8,Ned Flanders,"You poor thing! I've heard about those robes -- flapping everywhere. Girls, welcome to your very own Ned and Breakfast."
11,Seymour Skinner,Willie! Cut me a switch!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, but then we'd have to stand there while we get the doors unlocked."
0,Homer Simpson,...and beat you with one of those big thick women's magazines with all the ads in it!
1,Marge Simpson,As President of the cultural board I was given a key to the concert hall.
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, buddy, I don't care where you go, but you can't sleep here."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'm impressed. You're taking this quite well."
0,Homer Simpson,What guys? I wanna see the freaks.
5,Lisa Simpson,And so the queens--
0,Homer Simpson,Those better be good breaks.
0,Homer Simpson,Pull my finger.
0,Homer Simpson,"BABY ON BOARD / SOMETHING, SOMETHING BURT WARD... This thing writes itself!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hooey! Whew, oh. You know, I never walk out of a movie, but Eech!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Y'know, it'd be a real shame if someone started investigating your ""Indian heritage."""
2,C. Montgomery Burns,This place is falling apart.
0,Homer Simpson,As promised: the miracle!
1,Marge Simpson,"Heah you ah, Homah."
5,Lisa Simpson,I can't believe he pays you so little. The crowd was crazy about you.
0,Homer Simpson,Gotta go.
0,Homer Simpson,Oh my God... Marge needs this. It lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.

10,Krusty the Clown,Oh crap.
0,Homer Simpson,To the panic room store!
3,Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, spread the word! We're seeing this movie -- tonight! That's right, we're breaking curfew!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Their teacher takes her shoes off!
0,Homer Simpson,But it's my burger.
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, Homer, you're like no one I've ever met before. You're dear and honest and open, without a trace of pretension."
3,Bart Simpson,Better make this count.
1,Marge Simpson,I don't know if we're gonna be able to get out. What are you writing?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Someday when I'm a grownup, maybe I'll go back and look fondly at our house."
3,Bart Simpson,"Man, this town's got everything!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Noble spirits, your time has passed."
8,Ned Flanders,"Reverend, this is just the kind of tomfoolery that's been on the upswing since you left! Pure, unadulterated tomfoolery!"
0,Homer Simpson,Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
1,Marge Simpson,I guess it's good that they're taking an interest in spirituality.
5,Lisa Simpson,"That's my dorky little brother, Bart --tholomew."
10,Krusty the Clown,Hey-hey.
1,Marge Simpson,"Look at these courses you'll be taking. ""Advanced Peek-a-boo""."
3,Bart Simpson,Duh. She said that because she respects Alaska's privacy. Just as I have no doubt you guys will respect Lisa's privacy.
10,Krusty the Clown,I'm not made of money.
8,Ned Flanders,Oh... well... that sounds super duper.
3,Bart Simpson,"Lisa, I know everything about addiction that you can learn from watching Dad. The first thing you have to do is get clean, so give me your pins. All of them."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Eeney, meany, miney... ugh, him."
0,Homer Simpson,Why don't you start a rumor that he's...ding-a-ling-a-ling hello-oo!
0,Homer Simpson,"Get him! I mean, woo hoo!"

10,Krusty the Clown,"C'mon, I'll give you a ride home."
1,Marge Simpson,"Uh... no, I-I guess I didn't."
1,Marge Simpson,"I thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability. Instead, people make fun of our lousiness."
0,Homer Simpson,"Will you stop it?! It's easy to blame ourselves, but it's even easier to blame Apu. He's makin' us look bad!"
0,Homer Simpson,Hm. We need a better idea. We'll have to find the town's smartest men.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, go on, you cowards! Fly off in a ""V""!"
5,Lisa Simpson,This is better than our house!
6,Grampa Simpson,"I'll bet you want a piece of me. Well, you ain't gonna get it, see! Ha, ha, ha..."

9,Moe Szyslak,"Guys, there's somethin' I wanna tell ya. Somethin' important."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I like him. He's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance..."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You said no fuss."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, it's him! It's Santa's Little Helper!"
0,Homer Simpson,And mine was snakes and yours was...
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, thank you, Professor Lombardo."
3,Bart Simpson,I need something for Show and Tell.

0,Homer Simpson,"Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on ""60 Minutes."""
5,Lisa Simpson,I could get two...?

5,Lisa Simpson,You know about I.M. Pei? I.M. impressed.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, it's a scam!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Raymondo! I mastered the slide pass -- and I've almost mastered the Denver slide pass... and, why is there always a ""Denver"" version of things?"

1,Marge Simpson,Impossible! Their commercial featured a talking frog.
3,Bart Simpson,No!
1,Marge Simpson,That's for a child's birthday. We're going to get this one.
0,Homer Simpson,"It was great, all right. But all I wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. Because when all is said and done... Prison rodeo!?"

11,Seymour Skinner,Except what?
1,Marge Simpson,Herb! How have you been?
0,Homer Simpson,You are sooo dead.

1,Marge Simpson,I've never heard of these Movementarians. Are they some kind of church?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,And also you should win things by watching.

4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Let me try. Will I get beat up today? ""All signs point to yes."""
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, now don't panic. It's possible the giant vegetables are invisible."

3,Bart Simpson,I did? Where is it?
5,Lisa Simpson,That doesn't sound like you.

5,Lisa Simpson,A shirt from that rap concert... Bart must've gone to the show. But that means...
0,Homer Simpson,I know you love me. So you don't get squat. Hee hee hee hee.
5,Lisa Simpson,Who wants to put on a leotard and get screamed at?
1,Marge Simpson,How do we un-repress it?
3,Bart Simpson,"You did it, Dad! You saved us! I'm proud you're my father."
0,Homer Simpson,"Could you, um... work any harder than this?"
5,Lisa Simpson,The hurricane's over.
7,Chief Wiggum,So Superintendent Chalmers can vouch for your whereabouts?

3,Bart Simpson,"What are those, Grampa?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"No, no it isn't! Don't listen to her! She's out of her mind!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"That's just you, Bart."
3,Bart Simpson,"I've been out here all night, man. Just let me know what it'll take for you to forgive me."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Homer, whatever you done to that little girl, you just gotta do something even nicer to win her back."

3,Bart Simpson,"Thank you, sir."
0,Homer Simpson,"I just want you to know that I love you, Dad."
0,Homer Simpson,I've been waiting so long to hear that.

0,Homer Simpson,"No, go ahead."
1,Marge Simpson,It's gonna be weird cooking without your tipsy father grabbing me from behind. But I think I'm up to it.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Now, the smartest kid. Milhouse?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, time to get to work."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I used a rhyming dictionary, but it only gives you options. The job of the poet is to say, ""This one, I guess."""
5,Lisa Simpson,This broadcast is from 1979.
1,Marge Simpson,"I call to order this meeting of the ""Springfield Charity Chicks."" As you all know, last year's cake and cookie sale raised one hundred twelve dollars to fight childhood obesity."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"What about us cool kids? Should we just ""chill out""?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh oh. You're busted, Dad."
1,Marge Simpson,It's no! His old bike is fine!
11,Seymour Skinner,I'm sure he'll pick up enough to get by. And the whole thing won't cost you a dime as long you're willing to take in a student of your own.
9,Moe Szyslak,Try this.
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm Lisa. One word.
3,Bart Simpson,Observe - a bike lock.

1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, here's your precious articles."
1,Marge Simpson,Now we're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours...
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, I am by most measures a successful man. I have wealth and power beyond the dreams of you and your clock-punching ilk. And yet, I've led a solitary life. The fair sex remains a mystery to me. You seem to have a way with women, a certain... how shall I put it? Animal magnetisme. Help me, Simpson. Tell me your secret."

1,Marge Simpson,I'm just so honored to have you here in our home.

5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, pay attention to your children!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, guys. I'll see you in a bit. I entered a thousand mile Baja Road race."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. I want us to deal with the issues raised by this book."

0,Homer Simpson,What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this?
0,Homer Simpson,"Goodnight, sweetheart."

11,Seymour Skinner,Jack Crowley.
1,Marge Simpson,All right. It's time to vote for the grand prize.
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, Doctor, it's what we've always feared: it's loose. Hugo is loose. See you soon."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, what's happening? Where am I?"
1,Marge Simpson,I didn't mind that he grew bald... I didn't mind that he got fat... I didn't mind that he got fatter. But no one told me he'd get older than me.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Bart, by special request of the Mayor's office, you are going to be left back."

3,Bart Simpson,I gotta get in that casino.
1,Marge Simpson,"Becky, I know you must feel awful. But at least this didn't happen after you were married."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's all right. We'll just wait until everyone else leaves."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"I'm gonna quit tomorrow, I swear!"
10,Krusty the Clown,Which one do you mean?
5,Lisa Simpson,He worked two jobs to get me a pony... he started me playing the saxophone you all love...

5,Lisa Simpson,Barbara Bush.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, listen carefully: John is a ho-mo--"
1,Marge Simpson,"I had a Malibu Stacy when I was little, and I turned out all right. Now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream."
3,Bart Simpson,How many verses does this song have?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, I see you, Maya. I see you every time I look at the moon. I see ya in puddles after it rains. I see ya in the glazed eye of a barfly who's had one too many."
8,Ned Flanders,"My LP of ""Dreamcoat!"""
0,Homer Simpson,You mean like some sort of madman?
0,Homer Simpson,"Son, I'm doing something I should have done a long time ago... taking you to Vegas!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, I've got good news for you. The dog didn't run away."
6,Grampa Simpson,What's the catch?

3,Bart Simpson,But I have fifty-two million shares! What's fifty-two million times zero? And don't tell me it's zero!
8,Ned Flanders,"Hey now, Marge. Let's not ""should"" this fella to death."

4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, if you sit here, I'll be the boy who sat next to the boy who ate the frog. And I'm already the boy who shared a comb with a boy who threw up on the boy who wet his pants at the winter carnival. P.S. I would've given you the money."
0,Homer Simpson,"Feel that, Marge? He likes you!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Mr. Burns, how can you be so cold- hearted?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Come on, Snake. You don't wanna soak all these people."

11,Seymour Skinner,I hardly ever let Mother fight for me anymore!
5,Lisa Simpson,That might work.
5,Lisa Simpson,I always wanted a jazz nickname!
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, that was rude and shortsighted. Patty and Selma have the map."
3,Bart Simpson,LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA...
0,Homer Simpson,Can't talk... eating.
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. We can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, I promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is."

10,Krusty the Clown,"No, it's a goat. You know, one of them lady goats."

1,Marge Simpson,"Hey, it's only money. And it did make a cool splash."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh baby. Let's give those seagulls something to squawk about.
1,Marge Simpson,"Right, right, right, right. According to Judy Kleinsmith, a professional freelance writer, fathers should take their daughters out on little dinner dates and treat them like a gentleman would. Then she'll expect the same from the men in her future!"
3,Bart Simpson,"So, you guys have any videogames?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Gabriel, are you okay?"

5,Lisa Simpson,"Good luck, Dad. Although I am morally opposed to the military-industrial complex of which you are now a part."
0,Homer Simpson,Say. That Ayatollah thinks he's better than America. Is he right?
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, nobody move. Nobody panic. When I give the word, everyone ever so slowly open your door and slide out. On the count of three. One..."
3,Bart Simpson,AND IT REALLY DOES BLOW...

5,Lisa Simpson,Now gimme my license! Give everyone their license!
0,Homer Simpson,Nothing's too good for my one and only.
9,Moe Szyslak,"I wasn't really gonna kill ya'. I was just gonna cut ya! Aah, forget it. Ouch, I better go check on Barney."
1,Marge Simpson,Oh my God. You've taught me a valuable lesson!
3,Bart Simpson,"Here's a Danish, Krusty."

1,Marge Simpson,Show biz is so fascinating.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Now, I've gotta slash 40 percent out of the budget."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Mom. I want to be a dancer!"
0,Homer Simpson,I mean it made me feel bad. The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. At least that's what I thought. I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.
1,Marge Simpson,"I believe you, Jack. Now let's get you out of here... Wait for my signal."
11,Seymour Skinner,Send him in.
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, Mrs. K. I have just the book slash DVD for you. ""The Answer."""

2,C. Montgomery Burns,Me not feel good.
0,Homer Simpson,How am I supposed to write a song with that stupid jerk bothering me all the time... Wait a minute...
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ooh, that's gonna cost ya."
3,Bart Simpson,"You're stifling my creativity, Dad."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Sometimes I wish a cat would eat me.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"You said there'd be fudge-icles, Bart. Where's the fudge-icles?"
3,Bart Simpson,The last place anybody would expect to see a moon: the sky!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Apu, how did you survive?"
0,Homer Simpson,That didn't sound like you meant it.
0,Homer Simpson,There's sand in my shoe!

3,Bart Simpson,"Now, this ""PLAY"" button's a little screwed up, so you gotta hold it down."
0,Homer Simpson,What the-- This is a gentleman's club!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Willie, sometime over the holiday weekend, the beloved Grade Four gerbil, er, Superdude, lost his life. I need you to air out the classroom and give Superdude a proper burial."
5,Lisa Simpson,Why don't you go legit and sell your shirts in stores?
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, have I ever shown you my Shattered Dreams Box?"
0,Homer Simpson,"See, it all works out?"
0,Homer Simpson,Stop streaming over the wall! At least wait till I'm through talking.
6,Grampa Simpson,My tailbone! And it was my last good bone!
1,Marge Simpson,"Credenza, credenza, lowboy, sideboard, portmanteau..."
3,Bart Simpson,"But it's my home now, sir."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you're not annoyed that Milhouse asked me to go to the American football game instead of you?"
0,Homer Simpson,I'm outta here...
1,Marge Simpson,There's another thing I've been wanting to talk to you about...
1,Marge Simpson,Yes we can!

5,Lisa Simpson,Shh. It's working. Look.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, since Edna dumped me, I've been wandering around this park all night. It's educational and offers mild thrills. Just like Edna."
0,Homer Simpson,Can I fight human-style? By slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile?
3,Bart Simpson,I'm tired of taking orders from G.I. Jerk. I'm gonna tunnel outta here.
3,Bart Simpson,So how can I get my shirts in stores?
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Barney. I may be a total washout as a father, but I'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on Christmas eve."
10,Krusty the Clown,And Patrick Ewing as the Genie.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, oh, okay... Hmmm. Um here."
0,Homer Simpson,"It's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I've got an idea!
1,Marge Simpson,"Will you two stop saying ""gummy"" so much."
1,Marge Simpson,Homie...
1,Marge Simpson,Ohhh...
5,Lisa Simpson,There were monsters on that ship. And truly we were them.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I always wanted to wear a necktie. Mom says they make you more--
0,Homer Simpson,"Stop that. I love my wife and family. All I'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. That's it."
3,Bart Simpson,I guess I'll have no trouble gettin' to sleep tonight.
0,Homer Simpson,Blueberries!
0,Homer Simpson,"Man, when's the last time Moe cleaned this?"

5,Lisa Simpson,This is hopeless. They're gonna demolish our house for sure. We're gonna have to move into a Motel 6.
3,Bart Simpson,Paying money to read books... the hell with this.
11,Seymour Skinner,"...annnd that concludes tonight's auction, which has raised a school record one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars!"
0,Homer Simpson,should I whack slow or fast?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,That plane crashed on my property!
8,Ned Flanders,Wait... you've all plucked a peach from her tree?
0,Homer Simpson,Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I've got a confession to make. This right arm... it's not mine."
8,Ned Flanders,You know it's the darndest thing -- women love you when you've dated a movie star.
1,Marge Simpson,WHEN YOU GET A PENNY FROM A CHUM / DON'T JUST BUY SOME BUBBLE GUM! PUT IT IN YOUR CAP! PUT IT IN YOUR CAP! WHEN YOU FIND A NICKEL IN THE SNOW / DON'T JUST BLOW IT ON A PICTURE SHOW PUT IT IN YOUR CAP / PUT IT IN YOUR CAP...

1,Marge Simpson,Are we cured yet?
7,Chief Wiggum,Go!
3,Bart Simpson,"Y'know Mom, after only seven hours in this amusement park, I'm finally enjoying myself. I'm actually starting to forget about..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Morphine, please."
5,Lisa Simpson,And you're not doing it out of spite?
0,Homer Simpson,Where's Hoju? Where's Hojuuu?!
5,Lisa Simpson,Oh! That'd be wonderful! Oh I'd -- I'd have to ask my Mom.

5,Lisa Simpson,Okay: A--
3,Bart Simpson,Jimbo killed him?
0,Homer Simpson,But I can only sing lying on my back.
3,Bart Simpson,"No, play!"
3,Bart Simpson,"My question is, ""If a son defies his father, and chooses a career that makes millions of children happy, shouldn't the father forgive the son?"""
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, Son! Tute on!"
0,Homer Simpson,Wow! A golf shirt! With my corporate logo on it!
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, this is my day and we do, sir."

0,Homer Simpson,"Hmmmm, I guess I could... But while I'm gone, keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there."
9,Moe Szyslak,"I'm spiffin' up the place! Jeez, can't a guy clean his bar for the first time ever without people makin' polite inquiries?"

0,Homer Simpson,Say it!
1,Marge Simpson,"No, ""Smapron."""
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, sorry."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, basic cable said I should nurture you."
6,Grampa Simpson,He was right under my nose the whole time. He lives in my retirement home. His name is Molloy.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'm sorry you're hurt, but you left me no choice. You were obnoxious at a level not even permitted in show business."
5,Lisa Simpson,How Zen.
8,Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, I've been singing your praises all day. Marge said we could have choir practice in your house tonight."
0,Homer Simpson,Now. Now. Nnnow.
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, are you having a fight with your boyfriends?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, can we take it easy on the taser?"
7,Chief Wiggum,We've already got an informer working deep cover on your dad. One he'll never suspect.

11,Seymour Skinner,"If you think it's so easy to handle Bart Simpson, why don't you do it yourself?!"
9,Moe Szyslak,I'm your man.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, think I can ever find another one like her?"
0,Homer Simpson,"You su-diddily-uck, Flanders! Gimme that!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Oh! Yippee! Fourth-grade A!

3,Bart Simpson,What am I gonna do? Good ideas don't grow on trees.
0,Homer Simpson,What time's the show on?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Why are my teeth showing like that?

1,Marge Simpson,"Reverend Lovejoy, Mrs. Lovejoy, Principal Skinner, Duffman."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, but I'm starting to wish I had."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. Let's just have some milk and go to bed..."

0,Homer Simpson,"No! No, no, no, no..."
8,Ned Flanders,"Aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. How can we sabotage his labor of love?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Well that'll always be the dream, but for now I got a job in the show business. From now on I'll be helping Krusty the clown after school."
0,Homer Simpson,For Marge?

0,Homer Simpson,No deal. Out.
0,Homer Simpson,"Let's try what chapter seven calls ""Un-sults"" -- insults disguised as compliments. Hey, Lenny -- it takes a lot of courage to wear suspenders when you're not in the circus."

0,Homer Simpson,"If he makes it, that's my son!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Look, everybody! Here they come!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Uh, more or less. Hey, is that manna?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Release the girl, Simpson."
3,Bart Simpson,A letter's comin' from school and I need to be home to keep Mom and Dad from getting it.
0,Homer Simpson,"Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead."
1,Marge Simpson,"It's so fancy -- sushi bars, a sixty-screen movie theater, museum of tolerance..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Guys, thank you. The words ""prime directive"" get thrown around a lot these days, but I'm glad yours was saving me. The saddest part is none of this had to happen, if Mr. Burns had simply trusted the human worker. Or if someone, anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Really? Excuse me for just a moment.
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, it's been so long since I've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig I am."

5,Lisa Simpson,Could you?
3,Bart Simpson,Why did they make that one muppet out of leather?
9,Moe Szyslak,"I uh, well... I never touched her, Homer. Homer, I swear, I never touched her."
3,Bart Simpson,"Keep up the good work, toots."
1,Marge Simpson,You're just a sweet guy from Springfield who wanted his family to have a better life.
0,Homer Simpson,I'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back.

5,Lisa Simpson,"Stupid Burns, cuts off my power, lowers my credit rating..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, he's not gonna get very far without that."

9,Moe Szyslak,"For one sweet summer, I was a true gentleman. As a result of which, Krabappel was lettin' me do her."
5,Lisa Simpson,"C'mon Dad, read the last chapter! Everyone says there's a big surprise -- I bet Angelica discovers that she's a wizard!"
0,Homer Simpson,No. No. No. Ewww. Why is this on the floor?
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, I thought your mother told you to take a bath."
0,Homer Simpson,I envy them.
1,Marge Simpson,You promised. You can't back out like when you volunteered for that Army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters'.
0,Homer Simpson,You're right. Gimme a minute. Hmmm.
1,Marge Simpson,Ba-ba?
0,Homer Simpson,This can only mean one thing.
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah. Wait a minute. It's the guy from TV. My kid's hero... Cruddy... Crummy... Krusty the Clown!
5,Lisa Simpson,What happened to my room?!
5,Lisa Simpson,"I was wrong about the Cooders, Dad. They're the nicest of all the transients you've ever brought home."

1,Marge Simpson,I was thinking more like protection for... down there.
1,Marge Simpson,Carpool!

2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Sorry, I was just, uh, thinking of something funny Smithers did today."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Rainbow... oh, Rainbow..."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Do any of these boxes have candy in 'em?
0,Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Marge. This place is great. Free admission, great grub and we got to use the bathroom of the future."

3,Bart Simpson,"Thank you, Lord, for delivering us from Reverend Lovejoy!"

0,Homer Simpson,Kids say such stupid things.
1,Marge Simpson,"In the Ovenfresh Bakeoff, clever presentation is as important as taste. So I'm entering my dessert dogs!"
0,Homer Simpson,"No, you're gonna get trouble."
1,Marge Simpson,This all seems a little elaborate for sloppy joes.
3,Bart Simpson,"Because I've always been an advocate of women in the workplace, Lis."
3,Bart Simpson,"You probably should've researched this first, eh, Dad?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Flanders, how did you make these amazing fish?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I shouldn't be here, I was framed!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"You know, Dad, just because your mission's complete, it doesn't mean you have to go back to pork eating, and beer-drinking..."
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm outta here. Skinny, Krabby, catch ya later."
0,Homer Simpson,I can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.
0,Homer Simpson,"We've talked about this, Marge. The hammock is a chore-free zone."
3,Bart Simpson,Whoaaa! Cool!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,My teeth!
1,Marge Simpson,"Wait a minute, who am I pleading with?"
3,Bart Simpson,That's the best you can do? You could've at least said you were giving her CPR or rehearsing a play.
7,Chief Wiggum,I just wanted to be extraordinary.
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooh, we're ""cordially"" invited... this Saturday... to join Otto and Becky at... 742 Evergreen Terrace? That's our address!"
3,Bart Simpson,The only gas is coming from Lisa's butt!
1,Marge Simpson,I think one side of our house is sinking.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, yes, hello. Now, I need to find a patsy."
0,Homer Simpson,Get off my property.
0,Homer Simpson,"I am so sorry, Marge."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Six hundred sounds good.
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, Grampa, I'm fine! I really don't need any more home remedies."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Are you kidding? I love it. I once had a principal like that. Now, come with me."
0,Homer Simpson,"A poker site is now safer than an American bank. Has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,To create a new and better world.
1,Marge Simpson,He's doing what he thinks is best...
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw, let him have this one, Lis. After all, it's Ralph."
3,Bart Simpson,Like Attila the Hun!
0,Homer Simpson,Even those guys look too civilized for me.
0,Homer Simpson,"What? By saying ""Macbeth""?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, hey Ned! Isn't today your cat's birthday? I remember 'cause she shares the date with Patty LaBelle!"
3,Bart Simpson,I thought dabbling in the black arts would be good for a chuckle. How wrong I was. I should have never read that book.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, you can't post news if you don't have any."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I know, and the crowd is so distinguished. The inventor of the walkie-talkie is out there."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, my fat grew over my badge."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's too late. The boy's ten years old! Let's focus our energy on Lisa and the other one."
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, I didn't steal that copper wire. I just thought they were throwing it out. Here, take it."
3,Bart Simpson,I can't promise I'll try. But I'll try to try.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Where are my kudos?
0,Homer Simpson,Kent Brockman!
0,Homer Simpson,Did anyone order a hero?
0,Homer Simpson,All right. But I'll never shop here again.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, what interest does she have that I could make common?"
8,Ned Flanders,All right.
5,Lisa Simpson,Are you sure mom is really gonna want a rusted-out kiddy train?
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, somebody's gotta be the bad guy."
1,Marge Simpson,All our children are smart. Some are just smarter than the others.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hooks for hands. Um, oh, uh, and he was wearing a striped convict shirt. And he was carrying a big sack with a dollar sign on it."
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! Are you all right?
0,Homer Simpson,How much does it pay?
0,Homer Simpson,"Great... oh, and I have this ""two heads for one"" coupon."
3,Bart Simpson,"And, thank you, God, for the bad things adults do, which distract attention from stuff I'm doing. Amen."
8,Ned Flanders,"Hey, Simpsons! Don't mean to be a pesto, but I'll be happy to watch your scampy shrimp."
0,Homer Simpson,"Five hundred dollars? Woo-hoo! Thanks, boy."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, it sure is good to be home."
10,Krusty the Clown,What is it? Is this Saturday?
3,Bart Simpson,My who?
5,Lisa Simpson,Daaaad!
6,Grampa Simpson,"If I get up, somebody'll take my chair."
0,Homer Simpson,"Listen, do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast?"
3,Bart Simpson,I'm not convinced.
5,Lisa Simpson,Perhaps there is no moral to this story.
1,Marge Simpson,I put the tax forms on top of your to do pile a month ago!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,The R.O.T.C.?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Uh, mom?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, Sara wants us to have S-E-X."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh my God, it's beautiful! Are you buying this?"
5,Lisa Simpson,How did she know I was there?
11,Seymour Skinner,Used as a noun it is.
1,Marge Simpson,That's one right there.
5,Lisa Simpson,I still don't believe all the founding fathers were Stonecutters.
1,Marge Simpson,Call it fate. Let's go...
7,Chief Wiggum,Hm.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Take her down to the diner at the department store there. Get her a roast beef on rye. Oh, and make sure she gets a fruit cup on the side -- she's worth it."
11,Seymour Skinner,"I know, sir. It's an embarrassment."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary."
5,Lisa Simpson,Mom said we could watch it!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I'll have the berries.
6,Grampa Simpson,Consarn it!
1,Marge Simpson,Her name is Lisa. And I wouldn't trade her for all the sleep-in Sundays and speed dating in the world.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Excuse me, but isn't that voice very similar to the Cowardly Lion?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"It's not foilage, Mom. It's foliage. Fo-li-age."
0,Homer Simpson,We'll talk.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Where's your messiah now, Flanders?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. Um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? The things?"
3,Bart Simpson,Big deal. It's just saltines and fig paste.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, if you make a documentary about your family, I can help you."
3,Bart Simpson,"Cool, she can fly!"
0,Homer Simpson,Hmmm... business deal.
3,Bart Simpson,"Step off, Mom. Rap is the poetry of the streets."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I wanna play dodge-rock!
0,Homer Simpson,"Pick me! Pick me! I've got hoop dreams, coach. I've got 'em bad."
1,Marge Simpson,"You kids do eat a lot of sugar. But at least Homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit."
3,Bart Simpson,Hey! It's not in here. You stole it!
0,Homer Simpson,I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when I'm around.
5,Lisa Simpson,I am not wearing this.
0,Homer Simpson,She blew it again! Woo-hoo!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Look, kids can be cruel, Dick."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, well Krusty stole it from Steve Allen."
0,Homer Simpson,Sued it.
0,Homer Simpson,"Look at me, I'm a billionaire!"
1,Marge Simpson,Did you like it?
1,Marge Simpson,All this hoo-haw about girls and math is silly. Women are as smart as men.
1,Marge Simpson,"Thank you, Moe. I know you gave up your dreams for Homer."
1,Marge Simpson,But I'm afraid you'll get hurt.
5,Lisa Simpson,Dye! Dye! DYE!
7,Chief Wiggum,"So, Simpson. Which one is it?"
5,Lisa Simpson,No! It was Bleeding Gums Murphy.
8,Ned Flanders,Here it is. The Holy Ooze.
3,Bart Simpson,You had a crush on my old sister.
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, I told you, don't draw on your father's skull."
0,Homer Simpson,So... lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if you aren't around to see it.
0,Homer Simpson,I am so stoked about Lenny's party. He said he's gonna make a surprise announcement!
1,Marge Simpson,I've heard about you vendors!
9,Moe Szyslak,"I wouldn't-a had none of this without you, kid."
1,Marge Simpson,That was you!
1,Marge Simpson,"I don't know what you said, but I'm sure it was beautiful. Oh Homer, this is the kind of night I thought we could never have together: incident free."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Good God. Homer, y'know I support most any prejudice you can name, but your hero-phobia sickens me. You and your daughter ain't welcome here no more. Barney, show 'em the exit."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Spinach farm, huh? That's right, you talk in your sleep."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I'm only here because I got blamed for a prank I didn't do."
3,Bart Simpson,I thought I'd investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs.
7,Chief Wiggum,"We're puttin' you in a dirty little cell. Not as small and dirty as this apartment, but you know, it's still pretty bad."
1,Marge Simpson,"Why, a woman invented liquid paper."
1,Marge Simpson,"Listen, buster. I had to buy a club soda I didn't want to get change for this phone!"
1,Marge Simpson,I don't know...
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, bosh. Anyone can lead a conga line. Hop to it, Smithers. Con-ga, con-ga, con-ga!"
0,Homer Simpson,How are you a winner? You're cheating in a fake sport!
7,Chief Wiggum,Ahhhhh... Ohhhhh... I won't be getting up soon.
3,Bart Simpson,"Shove it? ""Shove it?"""
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. But you made us friends."
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man!"
9,Moe Szyslak,Yuh-huh.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, let's cut to the chase. My board has given me permission to go up to... twelve goats."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh, c'mon, Edna. We both know these children have no future."
0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! We're Region One! We're Region One!
0,Homer Simpson,For all of us. Look.
0,Homer Simpson,Oh no you don't.
3,Bart Simpson,We're lumberjacks!
7,Chief Wiggum,You're lucky he's still alive! This freezer is an attractive nuisance. Just look at all that ice cream. It's damn near irresistible!
3,Bart Simpson,"And don't worry, all the laundry and dirty dishes'll be there when you get back."
0,Homer Simpson,Line...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Moe, can I give you some shrimp for the road?"
9,Moe Szyslak,Stickin' it to you for killin' off my character!
0,Homer Simpson,A lot can happen when you're lookin' the other way.
0,Homer Simpson,I was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. Now let's go to bed.
1,Marge Simpson,It's not boring. He's passionate about government.
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, the poor thing's in pain. What he needs is a visit from kindly old Dr. Foot."
0,Homer Simpson,They know I'm kidding.
5,Lisa Simpson,Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!
1,Marge Simpson,So You've Settled for Branson.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,How could Krabappel take my cell phone? I'm only on month one of a sixty-month plan!
0,Homer Simpson,Get tickets. Must get tickets. Find phone. Yes!
5,Lisa Simpson,My hero isn't famous...
6,Grampa Simpson,"Well, you're really asking two questions there. The first one takes me back to 1934. Admiral Byrd had just reached the Pole, only hours ahead of the Three Stooges...And I guess he won the argument, but I walked away with the turnips. The following morning, I resigned my commission in the coast guard. The next thing I heard, there was civil war in Spain."
5,Lisa Simpson,"So I never want to see another Christmas tree... until Mom comes back, safe and sound."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Whoa! She's everything I want to be!
3,Bart Simpson,What's wrong with stinky?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I can't risk it. I won't allow that Simpson boy to take the Hellfish Bonanza, and I can't get it without his key!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I guess we better get used to being pariahs.
3,Bart Simpson,"Ah, cool, man. Space Mutants 4. Drop me off! Drop me off!"
1,Marge Simpson,You never told me about that.
0,Homer Simpson,They like me because I'm brave.
0,Homer Simpson,"We need to replace them with kick-ass ""going-down"" parts."
3,Bart Simpson,"All right, I got another one!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you calling him a sissy. This guy's a fruit! And a -- No, wait, wait, wait -- ""queer!"" Queer, queer. That's what you like to be called, right?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Forget it, Dad. I guess I'm never gonna be your Broadway Baby."
0,Homer Simpson,"That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't PAAAAART!!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh! Oh wait, there's more!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, slap a fern on there, boy. Now, some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little mollusk. And mollusk for me. All right. We're ready to hit the town."
0,Homer Simpson,Come again?
0,Homer Simpson,Shut up boy.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Mom, would it help if ah talked lahk this, too?"
0,Homer Simpson,What? I'll show him. I'll show that guy!
0,Homer Simpson,Yes way!
0,Homer Simpson,"I wrote it about Shelbyville, then changed the names."
1,Marge Simpson,Although it was suspiciously pro-lawnmower.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hm, don't give it a second thought. I didn't."
0,Homer Simpson,Sure... unless another aunt dies.
1,Marge Simpson,I'm still mad at you from last night.
9,Moe Szyslak,Wait a minute. I'm at work. Ya gotta pay for it.
0,Homer Simpson,"No! Please, please, please, please, please..."
0,Homer Simpson,"You know me, Marge. I crave the hustle and bustle."
0,Homer Simpson,"So what do we do with our friend here? Uh, throw him in the dumpster?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"My older brother was trampled by a horse, my sister died of a poisoned potato, my twin was shot, that girl was stabbed, he ate another poisoned potato, spontaneous combustion, fell down a well, potato, potato, and impaled on the Chrysler Building."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw boy, I feel for ya. Nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you're just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love."
0,Homer Simpson,Do I sound okay?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ummm, no."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero."
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win."
0,Homer Simpson,"Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy."
10,Krusty the Clown,I sought shelter in a nearby tent.
0,Homer Simpson,Mrs. Bellamy's necklace!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Actually, Bart, you're kinda creepin' me out. Uh, I think I'm gonna go sit, uh... with that foreign exchange student."
9,Moe Szyslak,"It all goes back to my acting days. I was auditioning for the role of Dr. Tad Winslow on the hit soap, ""It Never Ends."""
5,Lisa Simpson,That's amazing.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. I pictured napkins... Homer, I want to throw a dinner party."
5,Lisa Simpson,ONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER THAT YOU'LL EVER DO...
5,Lisa Simpson,Me too. The walls are paper-thin.
3,Bart Simpson,Well I think it's wonderful. My diet starts tomor-row!
6,Grampa Simpson,That takes care of my next one.
0,Homer Simpson,"When will you Australians learn? In America, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. The streets are safe. Old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. And the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. So, like us, let your children run wild and free. Because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. Now boy, run back to the embassy! Back to American soil!"
0,Homer Simpson,Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Shut up! Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson!
0,Homer Simpson,Well I didn't mean to!
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, for you kids maybe. For dads, a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job! ""Are you wearing enough sun block?"" ""Is that splashing or drowning?"""
0,Homer Simpson,Hey wait! Stop! I have garbage!
1,Marge Simpson,"Hello, Helen? I'm calling about the recent destruction of our town. Well, I have a little plan to fix their wagon."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, strangling. I mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! Right? Anyway, I said ""Bart""..."
7,Chief Wiggum,"There they go. Two criminal geniuses, locked away together.... Who knows what diabolical scheme they might concoct?"
1,Marge Simpson,AHHH!!
0,Homer Simpson,Bye Lurleen.
0,Homer Simpson,There's no time to be careful.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, I love you, and I'm glad we're finally using our wedding china, but when you're helping to pick the next leader of the free world..."
11,Seymour Skinner,Nonsense. One of our good citizens will slow down and wave me in.
3,Bart Simpson,Wanna get a snow cone?
5,Lisa Simpson,A couple of hours...
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, Bart. We've learned that war is not the answer."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, it's not your fault, dad. You did fine. It's just that Poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. You can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords."
9,Moe Szyslak,I don't need youse. I'm all the company I need.
11,Seymour Skinner,You had a turn. I want to guess.
0,Homer Simpson,Almost... holy moley...
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Heeere's Millie!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, you're not Milhouse."
3,Bart Simpson,WOWWW!!
0,Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, that sounds like a wager to me."
8,Ned Flanders,You ever operated a power boat?
3,Bart Simpson,Well that's what she is! I looked it up.
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, I guess he wasn't killed in Vietnam."
3,Bart Simpson,Hot! Hot! Hot!
6,Grampa Simpson,Skeeter bites are good luck. Scratch it and you get a wish.
6,Grampa Simpson,Go back to being a villain? Forget that! Being hated is the worst feeling there is.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, oh oh oh! Now Maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Why don't you finish your own darn...
0,Homer Simpson,It--
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't want to go to New York City."
3,Bart Simpson,"What should I do, Lord? Give me a sign."
8,Ned Flanders,But neighbor... why did you have to do this? I've tattled this town into a paradise!
1,Marge Simpson,"It's our last family dinner for six weeks, but I promised myself I wouldn't cry."
5,Lisa Simpson,It was so scary thinking something might happen to you guys.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, relax. She knows she's the apple of the corner of my eye."
0,Homer Simpson,Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.
3,Bart Simpson,"Soul? Come on, Milhouse. There's no such thing as a soul. It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogeyman or Michael Jackson."
3,Bart Simpson,"Go crazy, dorks. I got better things to do."
0,Homer Simpson,"What'd ya say, Marge?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, are you? Well, you go ahead and call your precious dog warden, you old battle-ax, because my dog is tied up in the backyard."
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, what happened to you?"
1,Marge Simpson,"I think it's nice we're doing something Maggie will enjoy for once. Besides, I'm sure Storytown Village is also fun for everyone... from 8, to... God only knows."
0,Homer Simpson,So cold. Warm me up.
5,Lisa Simpson,Don't worry. I called some animal activists who can help us get in. I'll just give the signal. Milk is murder!
0,Homer Simpson,Well... it might be cold outside.
11,Seymour Skinner,Cherry cordials. I hope you like 'em.
0,Homer Simpson,"Come on, you're holding out on me."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Damnation! What kind of slowcoaches do I have working for me? Ah, here comes one of our fellows now."
3,Bart Simpson,It's a game. We're not hurtin' anybody.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Marge, don't you love it when our hands meet in the popcorn tub?"
0,Homer Simpson,Where did you come from?
0,Homer Simpson,Sort of!
3,Bart Simpson,Ah. No day would be completely wasted without a visit to the old joke shop.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Y'see, Bob, Bart was never convinced you were Walt."
5,Lisa Simpson,It's better if you don't.
1,Marge Simpson,"Hey, kids! I scream, you scream, we all scream for..."
5,Lisa Simpson,I can't believe my Mom would cheat.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Friday night. You want to come over?"
5,Lisa Simpson,It's lucky for me that Legs was an experienced mob doctor.
5,Lisa Simpson,"You have to offer people something: a joke, an opinion, an idea..."
0,Homer Simpson,"It's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!"
3,Bart Simpson,"So, the soft fur, big eyes and gentle motion are designed to make it one helluva pet with none of the poop."
0,Homer Simpson,My wife has never seen my head naked. Maybe I should wear a cowboy hat.
3,Bart Simpson,"Lis, why did you do it?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, that's so sad!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Hmm, I know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?"
0,Homer Simpson,Goodnight and good gravy.
0,Homer Simpson,"Or worse, am I right?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"She's very pretty, but the answer is still no."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Now in the spirit of the season, start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold."
0,Homer Simpson,"I told you, I have too much time on my hands."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ya know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm gonna punch Lenny in the back of the head."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,All you've got to do is sell fracking to your friends and neighbors.
0,Homer Simpson,"But don't worry, because you've got a big brother who loves you and will always look out for you."
3,Bart Simpson,"Right on, Dad!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I'd love to!
5,Lisa Simpson,You mean those leagues where parents push their kids into vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory?
0,Homer Simpson,The thing is -- oof! -- Bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!
7,Chief Wiggum,"You know what they do to parking meter thieves in prison? They probably treat 'em pretty well. But when you get out, you're not eligible for jury duty. Which again, sounds pretty good."
0,Homer Simpson,Kids are so afraid of being terminated.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,A hundred.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but aren't we forgetting something, Flanders?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oooh, how about paint-by-numbers?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"That won't help, Dad. No one's ever going to believe me."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah y'know, if this is what women like, I should be a lot more popular. But it does inspire me to work on my fan fiction."
0,Homer Simpson,"And now, my darling, it's finally time for romance. But before the intercourse, the dinner course."
8,Ned Flanders,"No, I just --"
5,Lisa Simpson,"As head of the Student Activities Committee, I have an idea."
1,Marge Simpson,It's sick! And I don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. Like Mr. Burns.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Slow down, boy. What's your hurry?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"""Take me here, under the disco ball."""
1,Marge Simpson,"You can do it, Paul."
0,Homer Simpson,And here's the worst part: I never get any time alone with my wife because we're all sleeping in the same room!
6,Grampa Simpson,But none was more memorable than...
9,Moe Szyslak,"Uh, Homer, you're drivin'."
3,Bart Simpson,"Put it all on my credit card, my good man."
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, I just thought you might love me enough to let me help you."
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm engaged to you, my love."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, my whole life flashed before my eyes."
0,Homer Simpson,"Look closer, Lenny!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck."
8,Ned Flanders,"Y'know, I knew a backstabbin' buckeye named Roz at Bible Camp. Twice as tall as she should've been."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, well...if it isn't the Doobie Brothers."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, hello Pierce!"
9,Moe Szyslak,The law? That jerk?
0,Homer Simpson,Ow! My eye!
0,Homer Simpson,I would kill for that.
9,Moe Szyslak,I'm happy on Christmas Eve. And for once it's not 'cause some drunk left a wallet on his stool.
8,Ned Flanders,"How 'bout it, Homer? Will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?"
0,Homer Simpson,Jealous? Me?! That is to laugh! The very idea... if anything you're the one who's jealous!
5,Lisa Simpson,But we saw your plane crash...
3,Bart Simpson,"Actually, we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours."
3,Bart Simpson,"Why, Laura. What a pleasant surprise."
0,Homer Simpson,Trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the smartest thing we ever did!
0,Homer Simpson,"Um... uh... So uh, Joey, is Wikipedia accurate when it says ""Walk This Way"" was inspired by ""Young Frankenstein?"""
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I have my pride. I'm going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma, and get back my most improved odor trophy!"
6,Grampa Simpson,"In my younger days, I was an ace crime fighter -- the ""Crimson Cockatoo!"""
3,Bart Simpson,"Quick, Lisa! Call off your..."
1,Marge Simpson,That's great. Then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, look. He's trying to get up to yell at us."
11,Seymour Skinner,I've got a bad feeling about this.
6,Grampa Simpson,Now you're talkin'.
3,Bart Simpson,"Ah, you mean like I'm dead? Yeah, sure."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hiya, Stretch! What's the good word?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Burning the candle at both ends, eh boy? Go get 'em."
0,Homer Simpson,You know what wood makes the best ventriloquist dummy: maple. How many hardboiled eggs do you think I can eat?
1,Marge Simpson,"No, no. I'm fine."
3,Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... This is for you, Dad."

1,Marge Simpson,You try it.
0,Homer Simpson,"Relax, Marge. It's probably just Homer comin' home late from Moe's."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, how about Grampa? He's pretty out of it. He let those guys use his check book for a whole year."
6,Grampa Simpson,Put it all on forty-one. I've got a feeling about that number.
8,Ned Flanders,"Now, in case all that smilin' didn't cheer ya up, there's one thing that never fails. A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy."

3,Bart Simpson,You have a drinking problem?
1,Marge Simpson,It's so cute you're going to a little girl's house.

0,Homer Simpson,That horse was instrumental in me becoming a man.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Well, goodnight and... Aw look, it's a tow-headed little fan. Whaddaya say, folks, should I hug him?"

0,Homer Simpson,No deal!
8,Ned Flanders,"Was that... uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?"
0,Homer Simpson,"It's like our honeymoon all over again. Aw, we even have the same bum looking at us."
0,Homer Simpson,"...and your infinite patience with a big, dumb jerk like me. Oh, Ned, I don't deserve you as a neighbor, but will you forgive a young, handsome fool and come home?"
1,Marge Simpson,"You were charming enough to win me, and that day you didn't have a drink in you."
0,Homer Simpson,"So I says ""Blue M & M, red M & M, they all wind up the same color in the end."""
9,Moe Szyslak,So this is all real?

0,Homer Simpson,A Saturn?
0,Homer Simpson,"I got it, Dad."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, you were elected to be seen and enjoyed. Don't hide your light in a smoky back room, making dusty old decisions."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Generation X may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people."
0,Homer Simpson,"He said ""tried""!"
6,Grampa Simpson,I'm finally back. The days I spent at O'Flanagan's Pub were the happiest ones of my life...
11,Seymour Skinner,I think the real question is who is this and where is Homer Simpson?
1,Marge Simpson,That's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.

0,Homer Simpson,Unortho what?
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, that's him all right."

1,Marge Simpson,"Got what, Homer?"
1,Marge Simpson,"More wheat cakes, Mr. Mayor?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Stealing home. It's so impossible. It's against every sensible instinct... it's, it's..."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Well, I tried. What's for supper?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Bart, go to your room!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Gee, is it always this good?"

3,Bart Simpson,Wait! What the heck are you doing?!
1,Marge Simpson,I'll go get the Bactine.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Nope. It says right there, school bus."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Principal Skinner, do you know anything about a bizarre hidden classroom underneath the school?"
5,Lisa Simpson,I make a lot of graphs.
11,Seymour Skinner,"They're just asserting their independence. If a child doesn't do it now, it may never happen."

0,Homer Simpson,All right! You caught us. What are you gonna do about it? Throw us out of town again?

0,Homer Simpson,"But I ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on Expectant Mothers drink free night?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"I don't wanna hit a ""sore"" spot, but can we talk about herpes? ""HERPES HERPES BO BERPES / BANANA FANNA FO BERPES""... HERPES! Ow! Hey, that spot on Gorbachev's head? Herpes, trust me... Anybody here have herpes? Huh? Huh? You people are the worst audience I've ever seen."
1,Marge Simpson,"Bravo, Pierce!"
3,Bart Simpson,That's enough.
3,Bart Simpson,"Cleaning graffiti off a statue makes a mockery of everything I stand for. I don't think I can survive here, Lis."

0,Homer Simpson,... and you may get a compliment from an attractive co-worker! Lenny?
1,Marge Simpson,Let me get a good look at you!
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, Mom. I mean, we love you and Dad too, but God knows we don't need to see you every day."
1,Marge Simpson,All we have left are the earthquake ham and the condolence ham.
5,Lisa Simpson,My movie got in! I'm going to the Sundance Film Festival!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Don't be afraid, little friend. You'll be the most popular crab on the beach."
3,Bart Simpson,Are you Rory B. Bellows?
0,Homer Simpson,And now to wreck their precious helicopter.
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, it's getting cold out here."

0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, Flanders! Thanks for saving our place."
0,Homer Simpson,"I can't make it in today, Mr. Smithers. I have Smallpox... Well, it wasn't wiped out in my house."
0,Homer Simpson,I've never seen Marge want to go somewhere so badly. I'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a DVD.
11,Seymour Skinner,Hm. What do you think of the banners?
0,Homer Simpson,Real doctor or PhD?
0,Homer Simpson,We'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.
5,Lisa Simpson,It's so awful.

9,Moe Szyslak,"Well it don't matter no more, Midge. Carl is gone, and we're already auditioning replacements."

1,Marge Simpson,"Oh Bart, I'm so glad you're okay."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well listen, lady. I've got so many problems, I.... I don't even know where to begin here."
0,Homer Simpson,"Watch this, Ned. They don't call me Springfield Fats just because I'm morbidly obese."
8,Ned Flanders,BROTHER NED'S GOT CHEESE ON BREAD / AND A SIDE ORDER OF SHAME...
5,Lisa Simpson,Ooh! Ooh!
0,Homer Simpson,WE BUILT THIS CITY / ON ROCK ANNND ROLL! Uh-oh.
1,Marge Simpson,A whole weekend? I don't know...
8,Ned Flanders,Son of a diddly!
1,Marge Simpson,What a perfect day.
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about Ren and Stimpy? Children, your father and I have fed you and clothed you, but we've neglected something more important. It's time to learn about love."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm so glad you could all come. I'll be reading to you from ""The Origin of Species"" by Charles Darwin."
8,Ned Flanders,"No, Homer! I just need to talk."
0,Homer Simpson,"... pitchfork, pointed tail... hooves are... cloven! We have logo, people. We have logo!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, then, we're just going to have to dig deep. Marge, go get the kids' college fund."
0,Homer Simpson,Ayyy.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ants have six legs, Bart."
3,Bart Simpson,I was supposed to be in charge of you. I can't let Mom and Dad know what I did. But I promise I'll take good care of you until you're well again.
0,Homer Simpson,"You name it, oh wise mountain ape."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, this doesn't deserve to win."
10,Krusty the Clown,Sarah Silverman.
7,Chief Wiggum,"You look around there while Eddie, Lou and I go ask a few questions. Like, how does a helicopter fly?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, it isn't fair. I'm ten times the Krusty fan you are. I even have the Krusty home pregnancy test."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, they're Italian."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, it's nice you have your best friend back."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh God, I need a drink!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, I bet that southern colonel doesn't even show up."
0,Homer Simpson,"In closing, you people must realize that the public owns you for life. And when you're dead, you'll all be in commercials, dancing with vacuum cleaners. Thank you, Your Honor."
9,Moe Szyslak,THEN BACK TO MY PLACE WHERE I WILL GET YOU BLOTTO...
7,Chief Wiggum,The McWhat?
3,Bart Simpson,We're not losers. Last year we finished six and five.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah so, last night I was closing up the bar, when some young punk comes in and tries to stick me up."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Mrs. Simpson, when you took off, you left a hole in Homer's heart that he's been trying to fill with alcohol for twenty years... God bless ya."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, it really did seem funny in rehearsal."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I hate Nelson's parties -- he makes you look at his baseball cards and tell him they're good. They're not good!
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh, this is good."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey! Thanks, monkey-man."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Uh, afraid not. License please."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Why are you doin' this, Bart?"
0,Homer Simpson,Bart was strangely quiet. Later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. That wouldn't last.
0,Homer Simpson,"Until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I'm sorry I'm gonna miss your public humiliation, but the Woolumbaloo Dirt Monument is just too exciting to pass up."

3,Bart Simpson,A cartoon axe. I love it.
1,Marge Simpson,What are you doing with my children?!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Well, when I came to, I was covered with a sticky translucent goo! Explain that!"
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance."
5,Lisa Simpson,You guys shouldn't laugh at him. Mr. Burns has changed. He's different now.
5,Lisa Simpson,Only kids are that incoherent!
1,Marge Simpson,...so then you delivered her baby right there in the elevator.
5,Lisa Simpson,G-52.
7,Chief Wiggum,Drop the marsupial!
0,Homer Simpson,"I love watching you knit. It reminds me of watching pictures download on our old dial-up modem. Remember that day we brought it home and it was all eee, ooo, eee, ooo, onnnggg!"
0,Homer Simpson,Comin' up!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Agh! Not my Extendo-Glove! Oh, they haven't made those since the war! Not... oh, not my Paris backdrop! How'm I gonna make fun of the Frogs?"

7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, quit stallin', Burns. Who'd you ice?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Yayyyy!
0,Homer Simpson,Butter-brickle!
5,Lisa Simpson,I can't relax! Being president is hard work. Maybe you should try doing something with your life.
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, I missed you so much, boy."
10,Krusty the Clown,"I get it, I get it! She's good!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"No, of course you didn't. The establishment I work for delivers pizzas to everyone, and then gives the customer the option of accepting or refusing delivery."
3,Bart Simpson,Medical waste!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Forget grades! With the right subject, you could be a great filmmaker. What comes to mind when you think of drama?"
1,Marge Simpson,I'm too nervous to sleep.
6,Grampa Simpson,"No, I'll have you know, I've decided to give my money away to truly needy causes. But a hundred thousand dollars just isn't enough. I need more."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I became the most popular girl in school, but blew it by being conceited."
0,Homer Simpson,"No, but we'll stop off at the da Vinci Museum on the way home..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"You're just a tiny ant, but you were strong enough to pull my brother and me together. Now go and be free."
0,Homer Simpson,Quick -- we can hide in here!
0,Homer Simpson,"There's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name."
0,Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, power plant. I'd better get out of here before I have a meltdown."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, I don't feel like it now."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, boy. At times like this there's not much you can say... especially if you don't know what happened..."
0,Homer Simpson,Sure do. Let's go get ice cream!
1,Marge Simpson,That's not how a family vacation works. We do things together while your father has fun without us.
1,Marge Simpson,"Ohhhh, how about this adorable sun-suit. It has a starfish on the fanny and it comes with its own pail!"
3,Bart Simpson,But your father said...
7,Chief Wiggum,"Uh, Earth to Homer -- I arrested you there last month."
0,Homer Simpson,Or die trying...
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, I don't know, honey. I've got a lot of therapy left."
3,Bart Simpson,"Only geeks sit in the front seat. From now on you sit in the back row. And that's not just on the bus. It goes for school and church, too."
11,Seymour Skinner,Mother?! Superintendent Chalmers?!!
5,Lisa Simpson,From now I will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes.
3,Bart Simpson,Just my arm.
3,Bart Simpson,What am I supposed to do here?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, it's so superficial to judge our new neighbor based on his furniture. He drives a hybrid!"
3,Bart Simpson,Uh... because I'm gonna bring it back to the store for store credit.
0,Homer Simpson,And that's when the CHUDs came at me.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy."
9,Moe Szyslak,Aye aye ya big dummy. Ehhh...what a dummy.
3,Bart Simpson,"Excuse me, Mister Goblin?"
3,Bart Simpson,I'm never ever gonna see anything interesting with this stupid piece of junk.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh, this is horrible. My spit-takes all have blood in 'em."
3,Bart Simpson,There's more than one way to lose a tooth.
3,Bart Simpson,"So what's the charge, Chief? Vandalism? Smoking?"
3,Bart Simpson,"And you should've seen the look on Hoover's face. In fact, here it is."
1,Marge Simpson,I didn't tell you to quit your job.
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again."
1,Marge Simpson,"For your information, our electric dishwasher is on the fritz."
1,Marge Simpson,"Calm down, everyone. Calm down. I'm sure they'll have us out of here soon."
3,Bart Simpson,I thought you wanted me to drum!
3,Bart Simpson,To Krusty. The greatest entertainer in the world. Except maybe that guy.
0,Homer Simpson,Hmmmmm.
5,Lisa Simpson,Now you two play nice!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, wait up!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Wow! I'm so honored you wanted me.
0,Homer Simpson,Oh no! Now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Learning?
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, thanks to you, we're having fun -- ""before you were born"" fun."
3,Bart Simpson,"Please, guys, give me a break. Can you give me the duckling without beating me up?"
0,Homer Simpson,Y-y-y-yes.
0,Homer Simpson,It's daddy's turn!
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm not sure if you gave my son any... extra help. But if you did, thank you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here."
3,Bart Simpson,"We've been looking all over for you, Dad. Where did you land?"
0,Homer Simpson,Yes!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Which of the babies is your favorite?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,...and work some stuff out.
0,Homer Simpson,"Maybe I do, son. Maybe I do."
1,Marge Simpson,Some anniversary this is.
0,Homer Simpson,I'M GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL!
6,Grampa Simpson,Flu?
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, son. Concentrate... Shut out everything but the sound of my criticism."
3,Bart Simpson,Wow. You don't know how impressive that is to a boy whose dad can't even get the dog to sit.
5,Lisa Simpson,"As one of the Simpson women, would you like to contribute something to it?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Really? Well, just for that I'm gonna erase all the saved games on your PlayStation."
3,Bart Simpson,This is the kidnapper.
1,Marge Simpson,I'll ask these active seniors if they know Gil.
0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! Can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where I carry my stress.
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, it was so great -- Knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ah, touchÃ©."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, all it means is we're providing power to the electric company."
5,Lisa Simpson,"There's something troubling me, Dad...but I don't think I can tell you because it's a secret."
8,Ned Flanders,"Hey, need any help, Homer?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"""Stars and Stripes Forever""? Oh, man. They're toast!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa's right, son. Your Mom is way too classy a lady to crash a private--"
0,Homer Simpson,"I don't know what that is, but it's not sitting!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Sweetie, everyone has an animal they can't stand. Indiana Jones had snakes, the Grizzly man had grizzlies, and... you know, I'm not crazy about opossums."
6,Grampa Simpson,"I did. It's me, Abe Simpson."
0,Homer Simpson,Even after we came to school?
0,Homer Simpson,Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. Ugh! Soccer. Seen it.
0,Homer Simpson,Marge that's...
0,Homer Simpson,Go. Blow.
0,Homer Simpson,"See, it goes: ship's wheel, Popeye tattoo, Gilligan hat, fish with boobs... and back to ship's wheel."
10,Krusty the Clown,And now for the exciting conclusion!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, a good old-fashioned lemon party! I call first squeeze!"
3,Bart Simpson,Skinner's tongue was blue!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, Mom. We use that same line on the kids when they're at camp."
7,Chief Wiggum,"High as a kite, everybody! Goofballs--"
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system."
0,Homer Simpson,But Sipowicz does it.
7,Chief Wiggum,"C'mon, people. The Prison Nutcracker Suite is one week away. And I don't see five sugarplums. I see five guys who don't know their moves and don't seem to care. There, I said it."
1,Marge Simpson,Nowhere scary!
0,Homer Simpson,It's found footage!
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore Grampa?"
0,Homer Simpson,FALL ON YOUR KNEES / OH HEAR THE ANGELS' VOICES /
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Fear not, Smithers. I'll move Heaven and Earth to save you! It's still easier than teaching a new assistant my filing system."

0,Homer Simpson,Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!
0,Homer Simpson,Canada? Why should we leave America to visit America Junior?
5,Lisa Simpson,You mean it's a new dress? Where did you get it?
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm stealing five Segways at once! And speaking of segues, I'm off to my next morally questionable activity!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, why aren't you at work?"
1,Marge Simpson,Don't you think the parts that aren't evil are a little pretentious?
8,Ned Flanders,"Hey, why that sounds like Gabriel's trumpet. You know what that means, kids?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Not anymore, Ron. Now, I'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. Something noble, but easy."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, now let's not jump to conclusions, everyone."
0,Homer Simpson,"Suck it, karma! Yeah! I'm talkin' to you, karma! Karma's a bitch, karma!"
0,Homer Simpson,That evil old bone bag... smelling of death... nose like a vulture... followed everywhere by that kiss-ass Smithers...

3,Bart Simpson,"What's for dinner, ma?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, you ate all the free samples. Now you're eating men's slacks."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Eh, that's women-talk. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to comb out my curls."
1,Marge Simpson,I don't know! I invited everyone that Lisa's ever met.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, okay Marge, I'll get along with them. Then I will hug some snakes! Yes, I will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. Now that's sarcasm."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again."
0,Homer Simpson,Wrong number.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,They'll be here any minute!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hm, what could I make from those two things?"
0,Homer Simpson,Hmmmm.

6,Grampa Simpson,"Blood, bile, spinal fluid, blood, other, phlegm, miscellaneous ooze..."
0,Homer Simpson,Super-Team -- fly!
5,Lisa Simpson,Huh? Where are the bees?
5,Lisa Simpson,I have about eight of them.

0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but what about Bart?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, I still get to punish you."
6,Grampa Simpson,I spent forty years as a night watchman at a cranberry silo.
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, dear. All you want."
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay handsome, that's enough primping!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, now we love the house!"
0,Homer Simpson,"No, boy. I want you to do it."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, Homer, this is it. Time to get back with the people. The young people."
3,Bart Simpson,What about the people on the bottom?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. Mr. No-Belly... Mr... Hasn't-Got-A-Belly..."
5,Lisa Simpson,Mr. Smithers! Mr. Smithers! I found another hurt shrew! I think this one has a twisted ankle!
0,Homer Simpson,Nobody shuts out my blather!
0,Homer Simpson,That woman means the world to me. Would it be all right if I read from my Bible?
3,Bart Simpson,"Hmm. Well, you can stay at my house until then. My parents won't mind, because they won't even know about it."
3,Bart Simpson,"Princess, before you marry Krusty, there's someone you should meet..."
5,Lisa Simpson,But Bart...
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't you remember, Dad? Flanders is the unquestioned lord and master of the world."
0,Homer Simpson,Duff please.
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, a houseboat! You know, the great thing is if you don't like your neighbors, you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else."
0,Homer Simpson,I hope this works...
1,Marge Simpson,Just a second!
9,Moe Szyslak,I wouldn't join one of your hare-brained schemes for all the Japanese girlfriend pillows in Kyoto!
0,Homer Simpson,See? It's like we don't even speak the same language anymore. The only one who understands me is that guy who married Martha Raye.
1,Marge Simpson,Grocers don't make that much.
5,Lisa Simpson,Ugh! One of them's playing my saxophone!
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes. I certainly do. Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away, but I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, I know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, boy."
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, um, it is a special occasion..."

1,Marge Simpson,Let's just write to David Bowie again.
3,Bart Simpson,"So, you guys like being cops?"
0,Homer Simpson,You'll do as your told.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, me too. Since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word ""pop"" out of all of our foods."
0,Homer Simpson,Wait! We have to exchange insurance!
5,Lisa Simpson,You're on.
5,Lisa Simpson,Me? Unlikely. My goony brother's always going to libraries. I usually hang out in front.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Neat! When I sleep at Dad's, I call this bed."
3,Bart Simpson,"Stupid books. Hey, a cupcake."
10,Krusty the Clown,"""Last night's comedy benefit delivered wall-to-wall laughs without exception."" ""The only exception was the embarrassingly dated humor of Springfield's green-haired, red-nosed hack... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Krusty the Clown."""

3,Bart Simpson,"Wait a minute, they're gonna kill Dad!"
1,Marge Simpson,I'm a little disappointed. There were too many aprons.
0,Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. How could those stupid jar-heads win?
6,Grampa Simpson,But we don't need anything to have fun but ourselves.
0,Homer Simpson,"You can't just ""get"" a cell phone."
3,Bart Simpson,I'm not fat!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, there's a balloon machine in the bathroom!"
1,Marge Simpson,"No, I'm here to buy one myself."
0,Homer Simpson,"No... No I... It wasn't me... It was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... I would never..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, out you go!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Well... some kidnappers might be after me. It's a big world. But in this case, I faked the whole thing."
0,Homer Simpson,"""Ass, gas or grass, no one rides for free."" It's as old as the Bible."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Here you go, Homer. A hundred and thirty-five dollars."
5,Lisa Simpson,"So, you loved her right from the start."
1,Marge Simpson,No! Everyone should be paired up.
11,Seymour Skinner,What if Bart took music lessons? Music lessons could channel his destructive impulses into artistic expression. I myself have been taking flamenco lessons.
0,Homer Simpson,Then you have a serious reading problem.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I did it! I found Lincoln's gold!"
6,Grampa Simpson,I gotta hole up here for awhile. They might still be after me.
1,Marge Simpson,"Actually, it took fifty-three hours."
1,Marge Simpson,And from now on I hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to.
11,Seymour Skinner,All right. Thanks anyway.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, the garbage man can, Marge. The garbage man can."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I've never heard of these bands, Mom. What kind of music do they play?"
3,Bart Simpson,There's no way that means anything other than I get a mini-bike. To the library!
3,Bart Simpson,Wait a minute. This whole thing was a set-up?!
7,Chief Wiggum,Allegro! Allegro!

0,Homer Simpson,"Run, Marge! Start the car!"
0,Homer Simpson,Stupid prey. They never suspect anything.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, that's coffee ice cream! It has caffeine in it!"
5,Lisa Simpson,It's amazing they've gotten five hundred and twelve shows out of this premise.
5,Lisa Simpson,ROCK AND ROLL.
5,Lisa Simpson,"It's not perfect here, but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind, Wikileaks is right over there."
6,Grampa Simpson,Oh. Death!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, indeed it is. Tonight I will be continuing my courtship of Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia."
0,Homer Simpson,Lisa! Do you have a stray dog down there?
7,Chief Wiggum,Oh nuts! We lost him.
1,Marge Simpson,You said you were at a parenting class!
9,Moe Szyslak,"You got that straight, Barn."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Excellent.
3,Bart Simpson,You weren't Lisa's hero. She just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero.
1,Marge Simpson,IT'S A DESPERATE CRIMINAL / ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW / PLEASE SPARE MY CHILDREN!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson. I won't be coming in tomorrow -- Religious holiday... The uh, Feast of... Maximum Occupancy."

0,Homer Simpson,It's my first day.
5,Lisa Simpson,Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Nah, it ain't that."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Wh... where are you taking me? What's happening?
0,Homer Simpson,"Better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's Sunday dress."

0,Homer Simpson,I just wanted to invite you to the wrap party. And that's my cue to exit.

0,Homer Simpson,Then it's settled. We leave Springfield forever.
1,Marge Simpson,"Hi, sweetie. We're just calling to check in."
0,Homer Simpson,That hurts. But I just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, oh, oh, I get it. You can't fire the players, so you fire the mascot. You make me sick."

1,Marge Simpson,Have you been drinking?
8,Ned Flanders,No-sirree-Bob!

11,Seymour Skinner,How could I? She wasn't even born yet.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, I am gonna write a note back to Mr. Muntz."
1,Marge Simpson,Did you have a hard day too?
3,Bart Simpson,"No offense, Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting."
3,Bart Simpson,"No, it's true."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hold on. Uh..Jacques Strap! Hey, guys, I'm looking for a Jacques Strap!"
6,Grampa Simpson,You're all gonna die in a pointless war!
0,Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, you're right. This note's about Lisa."
8,Ned Flanders,"Simpson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I hope you understand."

3,Bart Simpson,I thought it was fifty.
0,Homer Simpson,Now what am I gonna get Lisa?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Sorry, Bart. But I can't just get rid of a teacher if he's doing a good job. Or an adequate job. Or just shows up and doesn't touch anyone."

0,Homer Simpson,I'll tell you why.
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooo, let's see what else they do wrong!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"It's okay, son. Just relax and it'll come."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, hide your shame!"
1,Marge Simpson,"If I give you money, how is the gift really from you?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Are you sure about that, Grampa?"
5,Lisa Simpson,People would be a lot happier without presents.
7,Chief Wiggum,You destroyed that drug shipment?
0,Homer Simpson,"Exception that proves the rule. If losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. Watch, I'll prove it."
8,Ned Flanders,"A woman askin' a man out? Well, well why not. And maybe I'll eat my steak with a spoon."

9,Moe Szyslak,"Homer! My customers are soberin' up, and they ain't gonna stay for the ambiance! You gotta get me more beer!"

1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, you mean like the ""A"" students?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"No Bart, no. Do it and you'll always be known as the kid who ate the dead frog."

9,Moe Szyslak,"And now, without further Apu..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Eww, I hate that icky soup skin."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Are you sure we can make money doing this? What if nobody wants their address painted on the curb?
10,Krusty the Clown,And the next contestant to be eliminated is... Clarissa!
0,Homer Simpson,Yes. We'll send the eye.

3,Bart Simpson,Little more -- little more... Little more -- too much. Take it back.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's Monaco."
7,Chief Wiggum,We don't negotiate with terrorists! Or the people that supply our uniforms and weapons. We just pay whatever they say.
3,Bart Simpson,"""Ages 8 to 80."" Hmm... That's me! Dad, will you get me this magic kit?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, your blue thing with the things?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!"

6,Grampa Simpson,"I'm down here, you idiot!"
0,Homer Simpson,Damn right!
0,Homer Simpson,Uh... Marge?
1,Marge Simpson,Because sometimes it's fun to use the good china.
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, it was probably that stupid cat."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Wow, that's the farthest that one of my eggs ever made it down someone's throat!"
0,Homer Simpson,For the first time I actually had to do my job.

7,Chief Wiggum,"So, you see what happens when you don't obey your restraining order?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I don't know, I don't know --"
0,Homer Simpson,It's settled. The stranger stays with us!
5,Lisa Simpson,It's okay. Those snobs never would've made us members anyway.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yes, sir. A very inane one. Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, there's a rocket in my pocket."
0,Homer Simpson,"Mmm, raisin detra."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thanks again, Dad."
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, you're pretty pushy for a book I just met."
3,Bart Simpson,E-excuse me?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I hope you like the taste of ringworm medicine.
5,Lisa Simpson,One jumbo Joe to go!
6,Grampa Simpson,"I assumed you were restin' up for bingo tomorrow, like me."
11,Seymour Skinner,"I've never been happier or prouder to be Seymour Skinner. But these last few days as that hot-headed rogue Armin Tamzarian have taught me a thing or two. You know, maybe I've been a little too ""uptight"" in the past. Well, from now on you're gonna to see a new Seymour Skinner--"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, bacon."
5,Lisa Simpson,It's eleven at night and I can't get to sleep!
3,Bart Simpson,Nutsy the clown.
0,Homer Simpson,Those are all normal noises. Luggage compartment closing. Cross-checking. Just sit back and relax.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, I did miss a few things about the grid... like everything!"
0,Homer Simpson,Then I'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.
3,Bart Simpson,Stop sayin' that!
0,Homer Simpson,That's great.
1,Marge Simpson,You think those could also have contributed to my fear of flying?
5,Lisa Simpson,"My pearl necklace! I must have lost it, and you were just bringing it back to me."
0,Homer Simpson,My mind is always open to new ideas.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, my special mix tape will get you going."
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah? Well I wish I'd married Patty and Selma!
1,Marge Simpson,Hmf. The monkey's on my part of the sofa.
0,Homer Simpson,Here you go. Just stop this bank robbery and you'll be a hero again. I'll wait in the car.
3,Bart Simpson,Praise the Lord.
0,Homer Simpson,"You know what you could do, Apu..."
3,Bart Simpson,Cool man!
0,Homer Simpson,Maybe I will.
3,Bart Simpson,Lisa's face?
1,Marge Simpson,"So tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. You'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Wow, we must really be flying high. Those people down there look all tiny and blurry... just like the inside of a cataract."
0,Homer Simpson,We... I... You come up with an excuse!
3,Bart Simpson,WANT!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh my God, me too!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Bart, not all community service is gang warfare and dangerous infection. And to illustrate that point, here's where you'll be working."
9,Moe Szyslak,Oh! Oh! Not the face!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Bart. I am so glad everything's okay."
3,Bart Simpson,"I come for the service, but I stay for the leg room."
0,Homer Simpson,Marge. They're only space mutants.
1,Marge Simpson,"Sorry sweetie, I just needed to get that out of my system."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, now as for food, the following breeds of dog are edible..."
3,Bart Simpson,"Jessica, I think this is too steep."
5,Lisa Simpson,This proves Bart lied about being kidnapped!
0,Homer Simpson,Mmmm. Fan-fugu-tastic.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Young lady, cow hearts belong in a butcher's window, not the classroom. Well, maybe in an older student's biology classroom, but that's none of my business. Elementary school is where I wound up and it's too late to do anything about that. Frankly, I'm starting to regret skipping you ahead."
5,Lisa Simpson,This is clearly a fracking site. How are they keeping people away?
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, but they sold a bunch off to that frozen yogurt chain."
3,Bart Simpson,"Blonde guys aren't dumb. They're evil. Like in ""The Karate Kid"" and World War Two."
3,Bart Simpson,Ooops!
3,Bart Simpson,"When I said my stomach hurt, you were the only one who believed me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Barney, no! Don't!"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, I know him. He's a man who has no son!"
0,Homer Simpson,How do you figure boy?
0,Homer Simpson,Why can't I have it now? You got your present here. Basic fairness dictates... ...oh!
0,Homer Simpson,Lousy traffic jams. The traffic report'll get me outta this one.
3,Bart Simpson,That's it -- game over.
3,Bart Simpson,"Is that story true, Grampa?"
1,Marge Simpson,I guess you don't have to leave till the holiday's over...
1,Marge Simpson,She's from Springfield! I knew her in high school.
0,Homer Simpson,Barney...
0,Homer Simpson,"Good, Marge. Get their price down."
11,Seymour Skinner,Wait! Don't matriculate those students!
3,Bart Simpson,"If it helps, I believe that after you die, you can come back as whatever you want. I'll be a butterfly."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm not a God. God has a white beard and invented the Da Vinci Code.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is yours."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey Lis, check it out! With some clever scissor work, I can make the ""LakeLand Butter"" Indian maiden show me her boobs."
0,Homer Simpson,"If I say no, do I still win?"
1,Marge Simpson,That's why he lashes out at the world.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh well... I... Forgive me, sir."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Really, mother?"
5,Lisa Simpson,So... where is he gonna sleep?
7,Chief Wiggum,"People of Springfield, please be cool like Lou."
1,Marge Simpson,"For five generations, women in our family have each added a square to it. Now it's your turn."

5,Lisa Simpson,My Dad's not here? I need a ride to school.
0,Homer Simpson,Ah-ha -- a sand horse! Car of the desert!
1,Marge Simpson,"I wish we could go back, but I don't think we're welcome there."
3,Bart Simpson,Cool. I'll give you ten bucks for that.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, you didn't touch your second dinner tonight. And you're reading books! Word books! What's going on?"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Aw, son of a--!"
5,Lisa Simpson,What a whimsical building! Who says science can't be fun?
0,Homer Simpson,"Shut up! It's my car, and I say we're going to the lost city of gold!"
3,Bart Simpson,You did that for me?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Professor, I'm um, I'm burned out on bartending. I, when I first saw the movie Ironweed, I thought, ya know ""this is for me."" But now, well, I'm not so sure."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, kids. It's time for Itchy and Scratchy."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, there's quarters in here!"

0,Homer Simpson,Must eat more fat people. Thank God I'm in America!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Door to door sugar? What a marvelous idea! What's that, mother? I'm just talking to the sugar man. Mother, I'm a big boy. I can do as I wish. Excuse me."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,It's about time. We've been making small talk about Mussolini for fifteen minutes.
0,Homer Simpson,Oh yes it will.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ten and two, Einstein!"
0,Homer Simpson,Night One. Wanna snuggle?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Let's see, social security number... naught-naught-naught, naught-naught, naught-naught-naught-two. Damn Roosevelt. Cause of parents' death... Got in my way."

5,Lisa Simpson,We've gotta tell Dad! Where is he?
7,Chief Wiggum,"You're going straight to the drunk tank, rummy. ""African princess."""
10,Krusty the Clown,"Dessert tray, that's a great gag."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, I always liked that guy!"
7,Chief Wiggum,Why don't you ask the person who filed the complaint? Not that I am authorized to release that infor--
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin to a wig outlet in Knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and Bart's working as a courier and just came back from Hong Kong."
1,Marge Simpson,"Let's go home, sweetie. I'm sure there's a hamper full of Homer waiting for me."

8,Ned Flanders,"""Discotheques,"" ""Frat Houses,"" ""Malibu."" Nothing about satellite fires!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them like that."
3,Bart Simpson,"See boy, it's not so hard. Here, roll over... roll over... like this."
1,Marge Simpson,Plus your school-yard chums: Martin and Ralph!
11,Seymour Skinner,Can't you do something constructive?
0,Homer Simpson,"Thanks, honey. So you're not cool with any of the toys?"

5,Lisa Simpson,"No Dad, it's just the weather."
0,Homer Simpson,Judges can't win the contest! Booooo!

0,Homer Simpson,They have any father-and-son grifts?
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm so sorry I threw you across the room and called you a liar. When you told me I was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me.

0,Homer Simpson,Shut up! One at a time! Lisa?
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, I don't know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone else's it'd kill him. On the other hand... I'll do it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, Mister Lobster."
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't mention it, Miss October. But don't look at her passport, it's different."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Bart, what's happened to you?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, I'm tired. I have to get up early to catch my flight."

8,Ned Flanders,Neither! And I don't like it when other people rhyme!
0,Homer Simpson,"And it was fine for the 1930's. The country was doing great back then. Everyone was into talking. But now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! And seats with beverage holders, but mainly action."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hold on there, boy. If you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight."

5,Lisa Simpson,Haw haw!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Bah! Fracking produces enough clean natural gas to make America independent of sheikhs, caliphs and... Scandinavians. Not to mention it doesn't create any of that awful worker-mutating nuclear waste."

7,Chief Wiggum,"Oh boy, this is gonna get worse before it gets better."
0,Homer Simpson,"What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet. Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head."
10,Krusty the Clown,Millions!
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm going to Moe's. Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm comin' back loaded."
3,Bart Simpson,That's very disturbing.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Honey, I'm home! Ooh, I got wax in my ears. Better clean `em."
0,Homer Simpson,I'll practice you!
1,Marge Simpson,Moe! No I don't love you. And I'm certainly not going to leave my husband.
0,Homer Simpson,To drink until there's no pain left in my soul. But first I'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall!
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but I'm on a plane, idiot."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Yeah? Well, take it up with their manager."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Not to me, Dad."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, but now their umbilical cords have fallen off!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"You're worried about telling dad, aren't you, mom?"
0,Homer Simpson,"See, Marge? Who needs a car wash when you can just drive around in the rain."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, look. Isn't that Woody Allen?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"""The Wind in the Willows?"" Oh yeah, Ralph brought it over."
1,Marge Simpson,"May I remind you that two people are dead? Oh, wait. I just got it."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh wait. I was supposed to take these with food.
6,Grampa Simpson,Get your clammy paws off my money.
5,Lisa Simpson,Let's just agree that the commercialization of Christmas is at best a mixed blessing.
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, you gave your word, you're going to visit him, no excuses."
0,Homer Simpson,Help... help me.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, Jay, I hope you tell your New York friends that people in small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think."
1,Marge Simpson,"How was your day at work, dear?"
0,Homer Simpson,But I eat... Oh.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Aw, Homer was spendin' money like a teenage Arab. He bought me a Rolex and, ah, cashmere jeans. I felt kinda guilty 'cause I was always trying to score with his wife. So, when do we start filming? Oh."
5,Lisa Simpson,WE'RE GOING TO A REST'RANT GRAND OP'NING / WE'RE GOING TO A REST'RANT GRAND OP'NING...
1,Marge Simpson,Look at them. They've jumped on the one franchise I might possibly have considered thinking about becoming interested in. I'm not cut out for the world of business.
0,Homer Simpson,Best in the West. It rhymes.
5,Lisa Simpson,"But Mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation. It brought us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors, and we have so many memories."
5,Lisa Simpson,Enough with the hose!
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, sweetie. But if I wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it."
10,Krusty the Clown,"All right, you know how it works. Every week we eliminate one contestant based on the votes cast by you, the audience."
3,Bart Simpson,LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA /
5,Lisa Simpson,Are you gonna call the police?
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, buddy. You got me confused with Fred Flintstone."
9,Moe Szyslak,That's right -- and business has never been better.
3,Bart Simpson,I certainly am.
5,Lisa Simpson,I guess the network made our show more exciting by dumping the house in a river.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh yeah, you mean like when your lazy butler washes your sock garters and they're still covered with shmutz?"
9,Moe Szyslak,At least I had a couple sips from your coke when you went to the bathroom.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Guard!
5,Lisa Simpson,Happy New Year!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, Mr. Jarmusch -- you've taught me a valuable lesson that other people have bigger family problems than I do."
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe, I need your advice."
9,Moe Szyslak,What are you gonna do?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I told him to do that.
3,Bart Simpson,"All right, commercials!"
0,Homer Simpson,Um... your cut of what?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, that's his stomach eating itself."
0,Homer Simpson,Guilty as charged.
0,Homer Simpson,Let's go to the map.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm just thinking of my employees -- all the card sharps, bottom dealers, and shills. Where will they go?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, there's my X-ray vision, my fire breath... and I can get big laughs with tennis balls."
3,Bart Simpson,"Thanks for the history lesson, sis."
0,Homer Simpson,I am a little pudgy. You got me. Yeah.
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town."
6,Grampa Simpson,I just had a nightmare... that I was back with your mother!
0,Homer Simpson,Salt water seems to be good for it.
11,Seymour Skinner,Please don't air this. I'll tell you the winners of the kickball games in advance -- you can make a lot of cabbage betting on k-ball.
1,Marge Simpson,Thank you!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"So long, sucker!"
1,Marge Simpson,"That's right, he did. Excuse me, but Dr. Hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought Bart was fine."
3,Bart Simpson,Read to Lisa? Why don't you just ask me to kiss her?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Attention, Springfield. We have barricaded ourselves in the school and are not coming down until our demands are met."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, the ticket price doesn't cover visions, miracles, or other Godly hoo-hah."
0,Homer Simpson,But what if I want some cooled water?
5,Lisa Simpson,No burglar? / What? / what's he mean?
0,Homer Simpson,"Man, Moe's barely got two nickels to rub together."
3,Bart Simpson,"We know you're innocent, Dad."
5,Lisa Simpson,"She's not plain, she's beautiful!"
0,Homer Simpson,Sorry Ned. I didn't see you down there. Got him.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Evolution and Creationism cannot co-exist, people. It is time to go back to teaching one single truth!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Just let me put some film in the camera, and then we'll hop in the car. You can get a picture of your Mommy with a mummy."
8,Ned Flanders,"Why thank you, Homer. It's a popsicle in my favorite flavor -- plain."
9,Moe Szyslak,"I was the happiest guy in the world. But fate likes to play a little game called ""Up Yours, Moe."""
3,Bart Simpson,Eh?
10,Krusty the Clown,"No Hell? Thank you, kid, you made my day!"
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm watching the road, sweetie. ""You jiiive turkey!"" See? You got to ""sass"" it. ""Quit jiiiving me, turkey!"" You gotta ""sass"" it. A turkey is a bad person."
3,Bart Simpson,"Sorry, Dad. Women and children first."
5,Lisa Simpson,Pennsylvania Avenue. I wanna buy a house.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer's Pie Man costume, Lisa's red dress, Lisa's red dress, Lisa's red dress, Sunday-best Bart..."
5,Lisa Simpson,Does it get you into special exhibits?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Dr. Nick."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and you didn't? Well, the worm has finally shown his fangs. Smithers, make me slap him."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, figs."
0,Homer Simpson,I've got to warn everybody about Hitler! And get to the ice cream store!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"But then, for once in my life, things went my way."
1,Marge Simpson,Weren't you just tied up in the blimp?
3,Bart Simpson,Xavier Cugat!
9,Moe Szyslak,Awwww... crap.
1,Marge Simpson,Those walls do look safe.
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, you can't just go around pretending to be Krusty. It's sacrilege. He's a one and only. I mean, he invented the pie fight, the prat fall, and the seltzer bottle... as far as I know."
3,Bart Simpson,Oh no. You are not taking the children.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Dad, we're gonna be late for the game."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, precious heirlooms! Daddy would never let them take you."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Mmm... I paid a pretty penny for this pretty penny, but it was worth it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Pleased to meet you. Uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but I have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that I can't help wondering about."
5,Lisa Simpson,Do not feed animals. Do not allow animals in the car. Do not make eye contact with animals.
5,Lisa Simpson,Wow... so lifelike.
11,Seymour Skinner,Y... you know... one thing I sho... Excuse me for one second.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yep, that's what happens when you get older. It's one of those natural things. Beautiful in its way."
0,Homer Simpson,And you know what the best part is? We've really done something for the children.
0,Homer Simpson,What would you say about a man who owns his own house...
3,Bart Simpson,"Excuse me, I'm looking for --"
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, Lisa, around here, Buddhists don't get any desserts in their lunches."
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, new bike!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Her films are so lyrical! The phone lines are gonna be jammed.
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah! You do your own dirty work!
3,Bart Simpson,You are so dead.
11,Seymour Skinner,Bart Simpson to the Principal's Office. Post haste.
5,Lisa Simpson,I thought this was a secret ballot.
0,Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, Bart -- I like your sheets."
8,Ned Flanders,This could go late -- we haven't even ordered pizzas and pop yet. Can you handle Rod and Todd's parent-teacher conference for me?
5,Lisa Simpson,Ralph and I used to date.
11,Seymour Skinner,It's true. I was in his platoon... But they said you were killed on that scouting mission!
0,Homer Simpson,What's going on? What am I doin' here?
3,Bart Simpson,"You're right, Mom. I'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing."
0,Homer Simpson,Too cold out!
0,Homer Simpson,I gotta call Burns! I gotta call Burns. Maybe I can still get that drink!
5,Lisa Simpson,What are you getting at?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, stop! Wait! Oh, any day but science project day!"
1,Marge Simpson,I'm Marge Simpson.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, yes and no."
0,Homer Simpson,"Be patient, son. A rushed car never crashes."
5,Lisa Simpson,Dad's heading straight for the Museum of Swordfish!
3,Bart Simpson,Wow!
0,Homer Simpson,Can I check out what toys they have?
0,Homer Simpson,It'll be real soon enough.
5,Lisa Simpson,We did it! We wrote an awesome song!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hmm, this is an interesting old book."
0,Homer Simpson,Ask your mother.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Bart. It's lunchtime.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hugh, there's something I want you to have. My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge, and they brought us good luck. I couldn't imagine a happier marriage. We don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive."
0,Homer Simpson,Smooth as a baby's behind.
0,Homer Simpson,"Dad, these are your great-grandsons."
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, all we have is carrot sticks and fresh fruit."
0,Homer Simpson,"Listen, I thought about what I did. And it was really, really wrong. I'm sorry."
5,Lisa Simpson,You're not even listening!
0,Homer Simpson,"Do you really think you can capture the Loch Ness Monster? I mean, he's eluded Leonard Nimoy and Peter Graves."
3,Bart Simpson,Care to concede that bet?
1,Marge Simpson,No surprises there.
1,Marge Simpson,Almost done.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Aieeeeeee!
0,Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. Like you don't know. We're gonna have sex.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,This looks like a job for Fruit-Bat-Man!
0,Homer Simpson,"Let's see... Apu's cousin is medium height, dark complexion, brown eyes, black hair..."
0,Homer Simpson,He makes me crazy twelve months a year. At least you get the summer off.
1,Marge Simpson,"I've been thinking, Homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? You taught Bart a very bad lesson. Your boy idolizes you."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Because after all, education is the search for truth..."
0,Homer Simpson,Make it stop!
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh. Too bad. Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now I'll get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Slid in through the grates.
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't look in my closet. In fact, stay out of my room all together."
5,Lisa Simpson,Oh no. Strike?
6,Grampa Simpson,"I love you, son!"
0,Homer Simpson,"If you haven't sprung from, or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house!"
1,Marge Simpson,...pimento nose... and voila! Mommy's patented Happy-Cracker Snack Platter!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, please don't go through with this. All through history, self-anointed seers have predicted the end of the world, and they've always been wrong."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I think you should take Bart to meet this exotic belly-person. I want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. I want Bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, it always does that."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Mornin'. Is it time to eat?
0,Homer Simpson,You're back!
8,Ned Flanders,"Mercy is for the weak, Todd."
0,Homer Simpson,Are we hot?
0,Homer Simpson,Mama took those batteries / She took 'em away / Mama took those batteries / Size double A...
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Hold that famous temper, Smithers, Who is this?"
0,Homer Simpson,A little!
3,Bart Simpson,I have made a fortune off you chumps -- and I've invested it all in Microsoft! Now my boyfriend Bill Gates and I kiss each other on a pile of your money!
1,Marge Simpson,"Now, we tuck in the tummy, the tushy and the tootsies."
5,Lisa Simpson,End of story.
11,Seymour Skinner,MY ADELEINE....
0,Homer Simpson,Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver.
0,Homer Simpson,Stop it! You're killing me! Seattle...
0,Homer Simpson,"Good idea, Marge. By the way, this Friday night I'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. Eugene Fisk is marrying some girl in Valve Maintenance."
3,Bart Simpson,"Did you know it was going to turn into a riot, Dad?"
0,Homer Simpson,Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
5,Lisa Simpson,They've taken everything!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,HAD A GIRL IN EVERY PORT...
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh well, make sure you return those chairs to the cafeteria, Kim. I'm not kidding."
1,Marge Simpson,"Shary Bobbins, you're just what we're looking for."
1,Marge Simpson,Or save the endangered Alaskan salmon?
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, your nightlight's burned out. And the only bulbs we have left are these red ones."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I know you are, but what am I?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Dear Lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. Sorry, he told me I needed a hundred and forty-four letters. What was my point again? Oh right. Bouvier or Simpson, I cherish you."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll take that, you stinkpot! Just warming up, Mrs. Bloominstein."
0,Homer Simpson,This is such an eye-opener. I always pictured the kids dying in the living room.
1,Marge Simpson,At least in Hell the heat still works.
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. Daddy will fix that broken animal."
5,Lisa Simpson,They're giant polluters but the C.E.O. is a woman. It's very vexing.
0,Homer Simpson,My personal hygiene has been described as...
8,Ned Flanders,"Look Homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our Lord, who came back as bread. That's it."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, exactly. That's the kind of pointer I need."
5,Lisa Simpson,What kind of song should we play?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Read the bosom part again, Dad."
3,Bart Simpson,"Ah Nelson, your debonair wit reminds me of a young Mort Sahl."
3,Bart Simpson,Oh. Fine. I'm tired of watching you two lip wrestle. There's plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I think he's serious."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"But finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Okay, that's better."
0,Homer Simpson,I've been waiting all my life to hear that.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"You! Strawberry, hit a home run."
5,Lisa Simpson,What? Who? Huh? What?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, I checked that out when Bart was born. I was gonna read to him every day."
10,Krusty the Clown,"We've got all your favorite characters -- Itchy, Scratchy, Poochie, Austin Powers Itchy, Itchy Poochie, Scratchbob Itchpants, Confederate Itchy and Osama Bin Scratchy."
0,Homer Simpson,Can you believe it? It's already been a year.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ladies. Marge, is there a small rip in my pants?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Yes! I'm thrilled! We've regained our family honor and we're one-sixty-fourth black!
0,Homer Simpson,"Put me down, you lousy-- Wheeee! Okay, I'm warning you-- Wheeee! I'll kill you, you son of a-- Wheeee! All right buddy, that's it, I've had-- Whee--!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?"
3,Bart Simpson,I'm afraid you'll hurt me again!
0,Homer Simpson,Uh... all of them. They're having a party. Jimmy Carter's passed out on the couch.
0,Homer Simpson,And there's nobody guarding it. Let's go!
3,Bart Simpson,Exactly. Crisscross! Do we have a deal?
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, a baseball field! Batter up!"
3,Bart Simpson,You stink.
0,Homer Simpson,Comicon nerds!
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, Marge. Maybe we're being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with. We'll take what we can get."
1,Marge Simpson,"You're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, you can't see how much I love my kids."
0,Homer Simpson,So? Just gimme some drugs and surgery.
1,Marge Simpson,Homer Jay Simpson!
9,Moe Szyslak,"What's the matter, Homer? The depressin' effects of alcohol usually don't kick in 'til closing time."
3,Bart Simpson,... speak!
5,Lisa Simpson,West Springfield?
1,Marge Simpson,"I hope you enjoy these German sausages. I've been grinding all day, so I'm not sure what organ meat is in what intestinal casing."
0,Homer Simpson,"So, what'd I die of? Too much happiness? Naked girl avalanche?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, I'm sorry. I can't make it."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Homer, please. Ha ha. I got a nuclear-type question, here."
1,Marge Simpson,It's what I do.
0,Homer Simpson,"Whew, that was one long helicopter ride."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Have you found any dirt on Mary Bailey?
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, you're under arrest."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm glad I'm back! Because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue, I was born again!"
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm so glad we took the subway. ""Laser Wart Removal"". Wow, the future is here!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Finally!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, great. Uh, well why don't you play with the baby while I go rent a room?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted."
0,Homer Simpson,Yeahhhh!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, never mind. Just pay attention."
5,Lisa Simpson,"So Bart was revealed as a coward, and now it seemed like the whole world was against him."
1,Marge Simpson,How did that happen?
1,Marge Simpson,"Thank you, Ramrod."
3,Bart Simpson,Thank God.
5,Lisa Simpson,That looks like an Olympic torch to me. Your husband could be an Olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career.
1,Marge Simpson,I want you to give up beer for a month.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Eh, well, that's what I do. Sorry, but there ain't no off switch for this."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I got an idea. We can play a game to pass the time. Uh, I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal, and uh, you all try to guess what it is."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Now, I uh hesitate to bring this up, but a number of cities have rejuvenated their economies with uh, legalized gambling."
6,Grampa Simpson,"How long you gonna be bunking with me, son?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Yeah, and we both have the special limited edition issue where he and Fallout Boy get killed on every page."
1,Marge Simpson,I don't have any diamonds.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Apology? Uh, geez, I wasn't expecting that... uh..."
10,Krusty the Clown,Give him ten grand.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, a fortune teller."
9,Moe Szyslak,That was my grandmother's wedding urinal! That's it. We are changing this place up.
5,Lisa Simpson,Cooper! Thy staves are not flush!
3,Bart Simpson,It's nine-ten a.m.! I know what they're doing. They're up in bed watching the rebroadcast of the Hollywood Christmas Parade.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, my best dress."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah? My left arm says different."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hey, it's getting cloudy! Oh boy."
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, Seymour! Mau! Didi mau!"
1,Marge Simpson,Did you say beer or deer?
0,Homer Simpson,Ah ha! Prepare to die!
0,Homer Simpson,Do I get two paychecks?
8,Ned Flanders,"Lighten up, Roddy."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you were supposed to scour the pans!"
0,Homer Simpson,How long have you been back there?

0,Homer Simpson,Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--
0,Homer Simpson,I could use a TV tray.
5,Lisa Simpson,It's gone!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Damn it, Smithers. This isn't rocket science, it's brain surgery."
1,Marge Simpson,"Hey, hey, it's Krusty the clown! What do you say, Krusty?"
0,Homer Simpson,Nah. They mess up my hair.
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, that'd be sweet."
3,Bart Simpson,"Whatever she's paying you, I'll double it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Of course you are. Marge, I've finally discovered the reason God made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. And I've got to share that gift with the world."
0,Homer Simpson,I am sorry I suspected you of being soulless murderers of innocent children. I hope we can move past this and...
0,Homer Simpson,Gersh Agency.
5,Lisa Simpson,...EVERYWHERE YOU GO
6,Grampa Simpson,"Thank you for this award. It is a tribute to this great country, that a man who once took a shot at Teddy Roosevelt could win back your trust."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Caitlin."
0,Homer Simpson,I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh.
3,Bart Simpson,Great gig.
3,Bart Simpson,This benefit concert is gonna be Scooby Dooby.
10,Krusty the Clown,Would you people get a life?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Maestro, if you please."
5,Lisa Simpson,"She means you should get a job, stupid."
3,Bart Simpson,Tasty. That calls for some tuneskis.
5,Lisa Simpson,Why is this movie PG-13?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, that's true. That's true, baby. Hmf, it'll be hell being locked away from ya, but I guess I gotta take my medicine. Unless... Unless, I send a letter to the police clearing Homer..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I figured out what I can give you that no one else can."
3,Bart Simpson,"All right, I get it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, Chief."
9,Moe Szyslak,I get it. I get it. That's your thing.
5,Lisa Simpson,"It's so beautiful. And just think, we're the first people to hear its song in more than four thousand years."
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't listen to him, Duffman. For once in your life, stand up for the little guy!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, maybe if he had better arch support, they wouldn't have caught him."
0,Homer Simpson,Yes. Yes! Got it!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh-ho-ho-ho right, the God dude. Hey, I got a question for you."
0,Homer Simpson,Why are you so cruel?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, the Simpson men are doing fine, right, Bart? You haven't even gotten in trouble at school."
1,Marge Simpson,I guess it would be a hoot to have my face on everything.
0,Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! Oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I looked into it, and it turns out I was responsible."
0,Homer Simpson,On vacation he digs wells in Darfur!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Now they're aggressive again! I'm sure there's a correlation, but could there be a... causation?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, Bob. You help us catch the guy trying to kill Homer, we'll make it worth your while."
5,Lisa Simpson,Self-published?
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, Dolphins!"
3,Bart Simpson,Whoa -- Playdudes!
0,Homer Simpson,But I haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, violin guy!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yuri Nator? Yuri Nator? Hey, my mouth is begging for a Yuri Nator."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, you're welcome, honey. Now, I'm gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. Got a problem, Bart?"
0,Homer Simpson,The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'll never outrun them in a museum!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Man, how'd I live without this thing?"
0,Homer Simpson,HERE'S A BLANKET THEY CAN BORROW

1,Marge Simpson,"How'd it go, Homer?"
0,Homer Simpson,"U.S. OF A! Great song, Ted. When's our next gig? Are we goin' to New York, or--"
0,Homer Simpson,There's a whole rack of 'em over there. I only ate two.
8,Ned Flanders,"Yeah, just a little shocked. What's that? Some kinda sorting machine?"
0,Homer Simpson,Your box made promises of a vacational nature. And I expect you to live up to them.
0,Homer Simpson,Why... I'm just...
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, delicious."
0,Homer Simpson,"But if we win this, we get a gift certificate."
1,Marge Simpson,Bart's right -- let's none of us have a cow. All that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"You did everything great, Bart. Then you told me all about it like a true gentleman. I can't wait to use your moves on Lisa."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"So, another Friday is upon us. What'll you be doing, Smithers? Something gay, no doubt."
0,Homer Simpson,I've never been afraid of a little hard work.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey hey, it's my old TV sidekick, Sideshow Bob! Why, I haven't seen you in years. Whattya been doing with yourself, Bob?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"All right children, switch."
1,Marge Simpson,"Grampa, we've been married for years. When are you gonna put down that gun?"
1,Marge Simpson,I know a little something about history. Gather 'round.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, I'm fresh out of ideas."
11,Seymour Skinner,Oh. That's much worse.
1,Marge Simpson,We've left it all behind. How can you make a clean break with your life?
1,Marge Simpson,"Cheer up, Homie. You don't need friends to be happy. I haven't had a friend in years."
1,Marge Simpson,Most of it was sent by relatives who couldn't see very well.
6,Grampa Simpson,Then prove it. I want you to charm the next pretty young thing that walks through that door.
1,Marge Simpson,"We're very proud of you, by the way."
9,Moe Szyslak,"No way I would abandon you, Raggie."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, it was so great. I didn't have to fake it with them. I was actually excited to hear about their day."
1,Marge Simpson,He's starting to wake up.
0,Homer Simpson,Zing! What's a Skeletor?
0,Homer Simpson,Fine. I'll never ever do another stupid thing. Good night!
10,Krusty the Clown,...not good-looking...
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hey, it's out."
1,Marge Simpson,"Shucks, Lisa. You sure have taken a shine to that cowpoke."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, fellas. Can I join?"
1,Marge Simpson,I always thought that was just a slogan to attract small businesses. But now I know it's the truth.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" Well, sometimes people can be too."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, ah, ah. Slowly. Make me forget my troubles."
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, uh, you punch really good!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,They were only on for twenty minutes!
5,Lisa Simpson,"People of Springfield, as a nerd, I understand your desire for revenge, but this sweet, harmless man is not the same remorseless monster who tormented us all."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh yeah, oh yeah, I sleuthed my ass off on this one."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Nah, I'll just take the ring pillow and these uhhh... seven presents I brung. Eh, you know what? Cram some shrimp in, too. Head to tail. That way you can fit more."
7,Chief Wiggum,Gun in the school!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Bu..but we don't have that kind of money. In fact, no school could afford to..."
3,Bart Simpson,Now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it.
5,Lisa Simpson,This hatchway is jammed!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey! Wait a minute, does this have anything to do with Santa's Little Helper?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"""Just The Two Of Us."" I spent fifteen dollars on those dance lessons, might as well use 'em."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooo, Diego's not gonna like that."
0,Homer Simpson,Just relax. Sit down. Not in that chair! It has no bottom!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah? Wanna bet?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ow! Help me. Why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?"
1,Marge Simpson,That's a lot of pressure to put on a baby. All they should be worried about is the raspberry monster.
0,Homer Simpson,It's not fair. I always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Actually, there are four plusses."
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Your lizards are banned by federal law."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, in my concurrent adventure, I learned a really important lesson: you can't wallow in despair. Face things as they really are."
1,Marge Simpson,I think it's time for us to go home.
11,Seymour Skinner,"If either of us falls in, we're doomed!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Name's Ned Flanders, I've heard of you. Haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm."
5,Lisa Simpson,How come?
0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I'm gonna be on time!
3,Bart Simpson,"Stampy! Stampy! Where are you, boy?"
0,Homer Simpson,That one.
3,Bart Simpson,I got Lisa's plankton kebabs!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, this is one of those dirty websites."
5,Lisa Simpson,THERE IS SOMETHING WORSE...
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Close one this year.
3,Bart Simpson,"You know Milhouse, I've been thinking. This town ain't so bad. Good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel sightings -- when you get right down to it, Springfield's a pretty cool place to live."
5,Lisa Simpson,Hey there ten-year old. I couldn't afford to get you a new drum...
0,Homer Simpson,I like those odds.
1,Marge Simpson,Do you ever hide beer around the house?
3,Bart Simpson,"But it looks so cool. Listen, there's a mole inside CTU."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Huh? Hmmm, oh, oh yes... Homer and Marge Simpson. Oh, and these must be Bart, Lisa and uh, ""Expecting""."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, no! Dad's been drugged!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Excellent. In that case, no one will be fired after all."
9,Moe Szyslak,No-it-isn't-I-don't-hear-nothin'-you're-crazy-get-outta-here-will-you-marry-me?
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, that can be arranged."
1,Marge Simpson,"Look, I want a cup."
1,Marge Simpson,"Why, thank you, Jack."
5,Lisa Simpson,What am I doing? I don't need secondhand smoke to do ballet.
3,Bart Simpson,I just buckled down and studied.
6,Grampa Simpson,Hot diggity! My family's come to visit me!
0,Homer Simpson,Now let it unfurl in your stomach.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, my gosh! Today's top story: ""Little Girl on Cloud Nine as Dream Comes True."""
0,Homer Simpson,"Idiots! Ooh, these are fun!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Hm... Well, okay."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Goodbye, Springfield. From hell's heart I stab at thee!"
1,Marge Simpson,"What, Homer?"
3,Bart Simpson,I didn't think anyone successful came from Springfield.
3,Bart Simpson,"Mmm, what's that exotic aroma? It smells like a hamburger cooked at a rug store."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, particularly their supple young organs. Oh unfenced back yard pools, where would I be without you?"
0,Homer Simpson,Who the hell is that?!
0,Homer Simpson,"Not that Army, the one from ""Stripes!"""
8,Ned Flanders,"Well sir, looks like we got some nice items here at Table Glick. Like this..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm sure you did. But still, don't you ever wonder what might have happened if things had gone differently?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mr. G. K. Willington is not who he seems. In fact, he's someone you all know quite well!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Of course I do, Dad."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh... actually my real name is uh... Think, Krusty, think... Joe Valachi."
1,Marge Simpson,My Homie's dead? How will I go on?
3,Bart Simpson,Who names these things anyway?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, Mom, you're not supposed to throw rice anymore. Birds eat it, their stomachs swell and they explode."
11,Seymour Skinner,"These are Bart's uncompleted homework assignments for the last month: worksheets, problem sets, book reports, math jumbles, dioramas, topic sentences, conclusions, bibliographies, synonyms, mean-the-sames, define-a-likes, word twins and one Thanksgiving hand-turkey."
1,Marge Simpson,Because she's bringing over someone very special. Her fiancÃ©e.
0,Homer Simpson,I wish I had Amoria Phlebitis.
3,Bart Simpson,It was just an April Fool's joke.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, they all look great."
11,Seymour Skinner,"All right, Bart, I didn't want to resort to this, but... this drawing was found on the wall of Springfield Elementary late last week."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,What the devil are you talking about?
0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! No pressure!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I --"
8,Ned Flanders,Blind spot?! Mecca?!
0,Homer Simpson,CHEECH AND CHONG HAS LOST ITS CHONG / I AM THE CHONG NOW... TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK / TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT ME-E...
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, honey, I insist. Because it's important to you that you don't turn out like me."
0,Homer Simpson,Coming!
3,Bart Simpson,They won't let you have any fun.
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, that was easy! All I had to do was click on--"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hello, Dr. Hibbert."
5,Lisa Simpson,"As I was saying, SpringFace was used in ways I never expected."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,...with rain baggie!
1,Marge Simpson,Quit playing dumb.
5,Lisa Simpson,What you heard was your conscience telling you to stop eating meat.
5,Lisa Simpson,I heard about this. This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy.
0,Homer Simpson,TRUCKASAUROUS!
1,Marge Simpson,I'm really worried about Lurleen.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Eleanor, we've got to do something about this depression..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, here it is, so we can open it and find out now."
1,Marge Simpson,...of school!
7,Chief Wiggum,You're going right back where you came from.
0,Homer Simpson,"No. I'm saying you're wasting everyone's time. But it's a church thing, so that's a given."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, I hope I get it too. Later!"
1,Marge Simpson,What? What?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Should Maggie be going with them, Mom?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you're the number one speller in this car or in that car or in that car or, don't look at that car."
1,Marge Simpson,"Come down, Homie! ""You only live once"" also means when you die, you die!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, I'm charging five bucks to get in. They deserve to see the boy behind the bill."
0,Homer Simpson,I've got a map!
3,Bart Simpson,Mm hm.
0,Homer Simpson,The devil with his fly open.
3,Bart Simpson,Heads!
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, while Mel and I are working, why don't you guys do the town? I hear all the stars eat at a place called Planet Hollywood."
1,Marge Simpson,Maybe he's going through... certain changes.
3,Bart Simpson,I should've known you were too smart to fall for that.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad. What do you say we toss the ol' apple around, huh? Sound like fun?"
7,Chief Wiggum,What's he doing in Springfield?
1,Marge Simpson,I want these springs out of our house today.
0,Homer Simpson,So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
3,Bart Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't just whale on him because he's... what religion are you anyway?"
1,Marge Simpson,You have to understand -- Ray doesn't exist.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh my God -- we're sealed in! Hey, nobody breathe my air -- get your own!"
11,Seymour Skinner,Johnny.
0,Homer Simpson,I'm no Supervising Technician. I'm a Technical Supervisor. I've never done anything worthwhile in my life. I'm a big worthless nothing.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, there are a lot of beer cans around here."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ah food. Good thinking, son."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Sorry, Homer, you can't take any more of my money. I'm, uh, outta the bookie business."
3,Bart Simpson,I get bored with them... but that won't happen this time.
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, a house made of gingerbread!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"As French Canadians, they don't believe in refunds, or exploiting animals for entertainment."
1,Marge Simpson,The year was 1588.
8,Ned Flanders,Because your father lives with me now.
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, I guess it is."
0,Homer Simpson,Is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets?
0,Homer Simpson,"...and that's why I really don't believe there's a God. Thank you, and God bless America."
0,Homer Simpson,"Way ahead of you, Marge. I am taking all four of my kids to the zoo tomorrow."
6,Grampa Simpson,Two-fifty for this?
0,Homer Simpson,Wow. Your end of the world is better than my during the world.
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah. Wiggum couldn't catch cooties at Milhouse's birthday party.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, I'm a real class act."
5,Lisa Simpson,My first word.
0,Homer Simpson,"HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, student government is meaningless. Look at your constitution. It's written on the back of a placemat."
10,Krusty the Clown,Don'tcha want her beyond all reason?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, that's your excuse for everything. I've got to do something to get my money back quickly. This calls for an aggressive trading strategy."
0,Homer Simpson,Here we go!
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. So -- will you marry me -- in style?"
0,Homer Simpson,Fatso Flanagan!
0,Homer Simpson,Stupid grill!
0,Homer Simpson,He's gone.
10,Krusty the Clown,Pay attention! You'll be writing my memoirs!
1,Marge Simpson,What the dilly-yo?
0,Homer Simpson,"No, Flanders. It's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. You wouldn't be interested."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Please, at least try the tennis game."
0,Homer Simpson,"Let me? Uh, sweetheart, I downloaded it off the internet... illegally."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh. What are you doing?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, you old fogies!"
9,Moe Szyslak,Oh my God! It's worse than I thought.
9,Moe Szyslak,"No, no, no, the complete ""Munsters"" on DVD!"

5,Lisa Simpson,A horn?
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, I gotta get in on this! These people have rights! The right to buy me a sixty-two inch TV!"
0,Homer Simpson,Various bug bites and wounds. Now stop interrupting your brother.

3,Bart Simpson,Twelve hundred bucks?! I better just get one.
5,Lisa Simpson,"It's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth."

0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, great. I got a field full of mutants."
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh-huh. Anyway... I was wondering if you could sing the entire score of ""The HMS Pinafore""?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Put a sock in it, preppy. How much are these free burgers gonna cost me?"
1,Marge Simpson,You're not married to Ray!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, it's all-- Hey, I thought you twisted your ankle."
0,Homer Simpson,"Nope, nothing, nope, nada, the golden ticket! At long last."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, remember when we were talking about our worst fears?"
5,Lisa Simpson,You know she's only fattening you up so she can eat you.
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, boy, sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Oh, man!"
1,Marge Simpson,That almost tore my head off!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"So long, Sarge. See you at the reunion in November."
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm not a big fan of detention. You might say, it drives me nuts."
0,Homer Simpson,Eduardo?! Is it really you? why are you here?
3,Bart Simpson,So I did make her pregnant?
0,Homer Simpson,"That was good, but Lisa, you're still complaining from your throat, not your diaphragm."
1,Marge Simpson,"It's deep fried cookie dough with meringue buns, cherry ""ketchup"" and caramel ""mustard."""
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, get out of here!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, Marge, it was horrible. Everyone was against me in that jury room. But I stood by the courage of my convictions and I prevailed. And that's why we had Chinese food for lunch."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, of course, Smithers. Anything."
0,Homer Simpson,"Thanks son. Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?"
7,Chief Wiggum,Release the dogs.
1,Marge Simpson,I thought you liked my hair.
0,Homer Simpson,It's called smoozing!
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, we can't give up. We're on TV. And when you're on TV, you dig in your claws and you never let go. Just like Bill Moyers!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, that's hot. There isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. Well, g'bye."
3,Bart Simpson,Sorry Mom. I gotta go.
0,Homer Simpson,"Herman, how could you? We've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? Hard working designers, like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt, or Antoine Bugle Boy. These are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, ""me too."""
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans."
11,Seymour Skinner,"No, mother, I did not use any of your talc. I don't know why the bottle feels lighter. Maybe you're just getting stronger!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I didn't know you cared about ballet.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, at least we're all in this together."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait till I get you home, boy."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Patience, Monty. Climb the ladder."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Apu, I'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is..."

11,Seymour Skinner,"Two cheers for Lisa! Hip, hip..."
0,Homer Simpson,...I GET KNOCKED DOWN / I GET KNOCKED DOWN AGAIN / YOU'RE NEVER GONNA KNOCK ME DOWN!
3,Bart Simpson,Um... that's kind of a baby show.
1,Marge Simpson,"No, s'okay. We can share this with you... Homer can't make a baby because he nuked his swimmers."
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, Milhouse, lets try out the new cup."
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, that's not how it..."
5,Lisa Simpson,I never made Miss Hoover yow-wee.
0,Homer Simpson,"Now Patty, here's a veil I picked out just for you."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, it's just easier this way."
11,Seymour Skinner,This is a public school!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I want my teddy!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Okay, now let's say I put a Lean Cuisine in a blender and I pour some beer on it. What do you call that?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Huh, ooooh, punch!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Mr. Burns acting nice? That's odd. He must be up to something.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Yes. Was that a real gorilla?
0,Homer Simpson,I'm doing a walk-on. It's a show business thing. So how y'all doin'? Let's see... What's in the news today?
5,Lisa Simpson,Baboon!
0,Homer Simpson,That's weird. He started off as an egg.
0,Homer Simpson,Me? But I'm the father.

2,C. Montgomery Burns,No looking at pictures of loved ones!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah. I'm betting on Jai-Alai in the Cayman Islands, I invested in something called News Corp..."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, but they were kids and we gave 'em candy if they laughed. And if they didn't, until the seventies I hit 'em with a stick. Some jerk tracked down the kids and made a documentary. It's called ""Circus of Shame"" or something."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,How'd you find us?
11,Seymour Skinner,Good morning. We have completed the tally of the votes for Class Representative.
0,Homer Simpson,Bart! I suppose it has..uh..various features?
1,Marge Simpson,And it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"No, no, your jobs are safe. They'll just be done by someone else in another country."

10,Krusty the Clown,"Yeah baby, greet the sun! Downward dog! Ruff! Ruff!"

3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, the chloroform!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge. How could you let me let myself go like this?"

0,Homer Simpson,All right. I suppose my work here is done.
0,Homer Simpson,"And some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them."

0,Homer Simpson,Her wedding china back?
11,Seymour Skinner,Otto! Are you meting out corporal punishment?!

0,Homer Simpson,That's it! You people have stood in my way long enough. I'm going to clown college!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, we've been going about this all wrong. What's the one thing rabbis prize above everything else?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"No, I just sniffed a nectarine. It's okay. I can breathe through my tear ducts. Tell me if this gets annoying."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Whoa! Wow! Man, you never know which way this crazy ball is going to go!"

5,Lisa Simpson,What's so special about this game anyway? It's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between Springfield and Shelbyville. They built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. They made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall.
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge. I'm afraid this gets my lowest rating ever, seven thumbs up."

9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, great present, Selma. Nice of you to break a five."
5,Lisa Simpson,"But until then this tree will stand for everything Mom believes in: home, family and constantly sweeping up needles."
0,Homer Simpson,"No, that's not it. What's his name? The Man of La Mancha."
3,Bart Simpson,"My bubble, my rules."
5,Lisa Simpson,"That's a lot of anger, Grampa."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mm, that is good grub."
9,Moe Szyslak,"No, no, no, no, no -- I want to be shorter for a woman."

6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, wait a minute. The family name is my legacy to you. I got it from my father, and he got it from his father. And he traded a mule for it. And that mule went on to save Spring Break..."

0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it."
5,Lisa Simpson,The devil? What devil?
0,Homer Simpson,"You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs. And to do that, you have to be stubborn."

3,Bart Simpson,I don't think we'll be hearing from him again.
1,Marge Simpson,"That doesn't sound like me. Well, I suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah well, I sweat blood."
1,Marge Simpson,Fish theme! That tells me nothing!

9,Moe Szyslak,"Okay, you crazy dames. I'll do it!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, Lisa, self-conscious about your shins? In my day, girls were worried about their boobs."
0,Homer Simpson,I'll bet no man would touch you.
0,Homer Simpson,"Bart, give me that megaphone of yours."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Houston, we have a problem. Homer 13 is spinning out of control!"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Bah. Why didn't you get something useful, like storm windows or a nice pipe organ? I'm thirsty! Ew! What smells like mustard? There sure are a lotta ugly people in your neighborhood. Oh, look at that one!"

8,Ned Flanders,Howdy gents. What can I diddily do you for?
8,Ned Flanders,Diddily.
6,Grampa Simpson,How much will it cost to build?
9,Moe Szyslak,Hey! Guys! What can I getcha?
6,Grampa Simpson,Your father was devastated.
0,Homer Simpson,I'm not asking for A's. Just incompletes.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hi, kids. How was Duff Gardens?"
3,Bart Simpson,Something better!
3,Bart Simpson,"I don't think so, either."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Come on, pretend he meant something to you."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, there's Ned out on his power walk. Maybe you should talk to him."
3,Bart Simpson,We tried to break up your parents and we broke up mine!

3,Bart Simpson,I don't know when we'll be in a septagon again. Wanna settle this bad blood that's been going on between us since you were born?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, if Hollywood movies have taught us anything, it's that troubled relationships can be completely patched up by a mad dash to the airport."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh God, man! Here, drink this paint thinner."
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, Mom."
5,Lisa Simpson,Oh my God! Krusty's shoes!

11,Seymour Skinner,You can't hide forever and I'm a very patient man! I once waited an hour and a half for a haircut.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ah, my new watering hole."
5,Lisa Simpson,"It really says ""die""? That sounds unusually specific for a horoscope."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Not talking, eh Willie? Just listen, then. I think I figured out what sets off that big ape Francine... Willie? Willie?"

3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, can we keep him Dad, please?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"It's not a crib, it's a cot!"
0,Homer Simpson,Flanders! Open up!
0,Homer Simpson,Hey boy! Do you know where the family is? Show me on Mapquest.

0,Homer Simpson,Don't laugh! They're doing the best they can.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Well, Maggie was crying. I heard her on my baby monitor."

5,Lisa Simpson,Bart! What are you doing in my room?!
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, Mr. Blackbeard, we're low on chairs and this is the last one."

1,Marge Simpson,"Can't beat a skybox. All the excitement of being in the sky, with the security of being in a box."
0,Homer Simpson,"Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels."
0,Homer Simpson,"Helen, I'm in a Caribbean mood tonight. How 'bout giving me ""Baby Elephant Walk"" with a little reggae kinda beat?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, Admiral Carstairs, I'd like you to meet my son, Larry."

5,Lisa Simpson,Who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent little puppies?
0,Homer Simpson,"Let's see: I need to get the baby, the dog, and the poison across the river, but I can only take one thing at a time. I can't leave the baby alone with the poison, and I can't leave the dog alone with the baby."

0,Homer Simpson,"Lookin' good, son."
7,Chief Wiggum,"I don't know, Simpson. How do I know you didn't cut your own brakes?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Is it ""The Count of Monte Cristo?"" 'Cause I love that story."
8,Ned Flanders,Naw.
5,Lisa Simpson,Grampa's been watching us.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hmmm. A bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. Heh, heh, heh."
9,Moe Szyslak,I'll eat your hair!
3,Bart Simpson,"No arguments here. Man, I really come off like a jerk in this thing."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, I don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"What if I gave you homework help? I won't give you the answers, but I'll give you the tools to find the answers yourself."
3,Bart Simpson,How was it?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Principal Skinner! The school's on fire!
3,Bart Simpson,This is all my fault! I planted Mom's bra in Milhouse's parents' bed!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hello, Ralph."
1,Marge Simpson,This is terrible. The whole point of coming down here was for you to get some rest.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, Bart's kinda-- No!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, son, all I'm asking is that you try."
5,Lisa Simpson,The black hole is looking a lot bigger. Does anybody want to admit to throwing things in?
5,Lisa Simpson,"My name is Lisa, Mr. Burns. Lisa Simpson."
0,Homer Simpson,Of course not. I wouldn't do that. Why not?
8,Ned Flanders,Never claimed to be.
1,Marge Simpson,Now it's ready for garbage!

1,Marge Simpson,Got a better idea?
3,Bart Simpson,"Twelve bucks! Hey, I can bleed!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Aw, Homie."
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, if the Korean couple can't speak English, why were they doing a crossword puzzle where the answer to twenty-three down was ""enigma"" spelled backwards? What does it mean?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Another seminar tomorrow. I just wish I could connect with those teenagers, since it seems like we'll never have any."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hello, operator? I'd like to make a collect call to..."
3,Bart Simpson,Be honest.
1,Marge Simpson,What the? What are you doing inside?
0,Homer Simpson,Just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an I.O.U.
1,Marge Simpson,And it came with a free instruction book.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Look, I was insensitive and I'm sorry. But what this is really about is a bully with a winch."
0,Homer Simpson,That still sounds like the smart kid.
3,Bart Simpson,"Cool, Japanimation."
3,Bart Simpson,It was just a game. A game I used to enjoy before you mommed all over it.
0,Homer Simpson,"Man oh man, you've got the greatest job in the world!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, you're back!"
0,Homer Simpson,...down...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Now do you see why I'm a vegetarian, Dad?"
1,Marge Simpson,What's so funny?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Sorry folks. Sorry, Your Majesty."
5,Lisa Simpson,This is worse than when we thought Mom was having an affair. It turned out she was just going to the library to cry.
1,Marge Simpson,I'll miss you too Homie.
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! You didn't even ask where Bart would be going.
5,Lisa Simpson,"I can't do this, Bart. I'm not strong enough."

5,Lisa Simpson,Okay... Why don't you...
0,Homer Simpson,You didn't tell me he was a soldier.
1,Marge Simpson,I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
0,Homer Simpson,"Of all the people for Marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me?"
0,Homer Simpson,Interesting. It's like a corndog without the dog.
6,Grampa Simpson,Tennessee Ernie Ford! Now I know you're dead.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, I created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yes, Grampa!"
0,Homer Simpson,You have to cheat.
1,Marge Simpson,Very well. There must be dozens of great locations in this town. Don't you worry about me.
0,Homer Simpson,Then whose garter is this?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you're driving on an ancient Roman aqueduct!"
1,Marge Simpson,I could have sworn it was three hundred and two.
1,Marge Simpson,Why can't our son just behave?
0,Homer Simpson,No food allowed in bank?
5,Lisa Simpson,We didn't invite the other babies. Maggie doesn't seem to get along with the other babies.
0,Homer Simpson,I don't know. Let's just lay here till we figure it out.
0,Homer Simpson,That's him.
0,Homer Simpson,I always thought cats were just for losers who live in apartments until my life was saved by this sweet little kitty.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,You dunder-headed stooges are the worst bunch of--!
8,Ned Flanders,So you are running a day care center?
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, Dad. I missed you so much, I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an ""F""."
0,Homer Simpson,"Thanks, guys. Tomorrow morning my sheets will be as dry as the surface of Mars except for the poles."
5,Lisa Simpson,And there's something different about him.
3,Bart Simpson,The hell I can't!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Wait, wait! Waiiit!"
11,Seymour Skinner,I was kinda hoping we could use this audio cassette.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ohhhh, Mister. Porky."
5,Lisa Simpson,But she's better than me at everything that makes me special.
0,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns is making me eat all these drums of toxic waste.
1,Marge Simpson,"Mm, no, I don't need therapy, I'm fine. And it's too expensive."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister?"
1,Marge Simpson,"...and remember, every morning give one bowl of kibble to Santa's Little Helper. Do you want me to write any of this down?"
10,Krusty the Clown,Second banana!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, I'm really not thinking about that now."
8,Ned Flanders,Always do.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Ugh.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Look, Dad wrote something: ""Dino -- short for dinosaur? Remember to ask Jeeves."""

1,Marge Simpson,Why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
0,Homer Simpson,"Can't talk now, Flanders. I've got a class to teach."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, while the plant is brought up to code, there will be massive layoffs. That is to say, total layoffs. Toodles!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,You just made a very big mistake. You'll spend the rest of your life in pris--
0,Homer Simpson,"Yep, well, that's what got me where I am today."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hm. Clean dishes. I either have to unload them, or, uh..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, would you care to continue this conversation on the teeter-totter?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Easy... easy. Line up your shot, then squeeze it off."
3,Bart Simpson,I don't see any breasts.
11,Seymour Skinner,Now wait just a minute. That wasn't discussed with me.
3,Bart Simpson,That dog's a riot.
1,Marge Simpson,How do you think I felt?
0,Homer Simpson,I like being thanked.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, every witch needs a familiar..."
0,Homer Simpson,"It all began about two years ago, before Maggie was even born. Bart, you were Lisa's age and Lisa you were the age Bart was several years ago."
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe, I can save you but you have to let go of the clock."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh, it's part of my public service for my glug, glug, vroom, vroom, thump thump."

3,Bart Simpson,"After dinner, can I watch cartoons?"
0,Homer Simpson,"You know what, honey? Just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm so scared. Ned Flanders is pointing a gun at me. You couldn't even shoot me by accident, even if I whacked the barrel like this."
6,Grampa Simpson,Come back. I'll tell you.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Lemme sell it, you idjit."
1,Marge Simpson,But my car is down there!
0,Homer Simpson,"Um, so... tell me about your day."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooo, too practical."
0,Homer Simpson,I just saw the greatest cartoon of all time. It was about a miser who was visited by three ghosts at Christmas. And get this: he learns a lesson!
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, maybe Mr. Burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship."
8,Ned Flanders,As sure as I am that Jesus hates Hip Hop!
0,Homer Simpson,An ancient Indian what...?
1,Marge Simpson,And don't put signs on your sister.
7,Chief Wiggum,"What the heck is goin' on out there? Officer Sniffy! Come in, Sniffy. Do you read me?"
1,Marge Simpson,"All right, just to the mailbox and back."
3,Bart Simpson,But Dr. Hibbert said not to stress her out.
3,Bart Simpson,"It's horrible in here -- the boys beat me up, the girls beat me up..."

3,Bart Simpson,I thought your car was really cool.
3,Bart Simpson,See ya in the funny pages.
0,Homer Simpson,"Welcome home, Marge."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, if it makes you feel any better, most of what they threw at you splattered on me. Homer?..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,SO LISTEN UP BECAUSE I'M GIVING / THE BEST ADVICE YOU'LL EVER KNOW / SO FEEL THE THRILL / I KNOW YOU WILL / IT'S A HIGH TO BE LOA...THED!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's so mean."
1,Marge Simpson,I'm trying! It just keeps popping off.
1,Marge Simpson,Maggie loves baby talk.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Chief Wiggum, we're just like you policemen. Don't you ever feel like the mayor doesn't care about you?"
1,Marge Simpson,Leave him alone!
10,Krusty the Clown,"I campaigned for the other guy, but I voted for you."
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm gonna call you ""Toilet."""

7,Chief Wiggum,"Oh don't worry, I'm the Pief of Cholice. I mean I'm uh, beef with no cheese. Why doesn't Lou like me? Why?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Here, here, quick! Use my Krusty eyewash!"
0,Homer Simpson,"They love me! The quiet Homer Simpson that kept it all bottled up inside is dead. This is the birth of Homer Simpson, blowhard! I'm on the roll of my life! Gimme a scratcher!"

0,Homer Simpson,Stupid horse! It's a deer crossing!
5,Lisa Simpson,Amen. Let's eat.
1,Marge Simpson,"Wake up Bart, rise and shine, little guy. Time to wake up."
1,Marge Simpson,Bart's been moving nonstop all afternoon. Maybe there's too much sugar in his Sugar-Frosted Candy O's.
1,Marge Simpson,"I say ""Cool Waves."""
10,Krusty the Clown,"Today, we'll pick the lucky children who will get to compete on the air. I was going to be your celebrity judge, but then I realized I'd have to pay attention. So instead, we'll use the Applause-O-Meter. Eh? Eh?"
3,Bart Simpson,The police. They couldn't catch a cold.
0,Homer Simpson,Five dollars cash!
1,Marge Simpson,But Mr. Schindler...
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, you bring Bart home now! Once you go Vatican, you can't go back again."

3,Bart Simpson,D.Q.A.T.?
1,Marge Simpson,Tell that woman it's over between you and her.
1,Marge Simpson,These magazines are from before we were married. Maybe you should throw them away.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I know! But how can I undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?"
1,Marge Simpson,One more to go and I'm done.
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it. This town is a part of us all, a part of us all, a part of us all. Sorry to repeat myself but it'll help you remember."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, what are you doing?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, you'll definitely want to get yourself a good doll. The new Malibu Stacy has an achievable chest."
9,Moe Szyslak,We're tryin' to escape that guy!

11,Seymour Skinner,"Though not now, because I have a series of important meetings."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,The glasses are off!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Homer, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret: cops don't have many friends. Civilians are scared of us, and uh, other cops just remind us of things we want to forget. That's why our friendship is so special to me."

1,Marge Simpson,Homer Simpson. Working with those plants is great! It's helped you get in touch with your feminine side.
5,Lisa Simpson,Oh my gosh. It's the mascot from the 1924 games in Chamonix!
1,Marge Simpson,"Please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help Lisa."
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! You have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they're a doctor!

1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, I can hear you chewing on your pillow. What's wrong?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Ned, I'm worried about you. You've been working non-stop for the past week."

0,Homer Simpson,Lisa? Lisa?
5,Lisa Simpson,Help! I'm trapped in an alternate dimension! An existential netherspace!
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, it seems real to me."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, and?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I hope the investors like it. I have to raise sixty million dollars or we're out of business."
5,Lisa Simpson,I read at a 78th grade level.

0,Homer Simpson,"Maggie, help me with this shirt."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey Bart, I think they're finally hauling your dad away."
0,Homer Simpson,Because I wore a pink shirt.

1,Marge Simpson,I invited Selma here to watch Grampa watch the kids.
0,Homer Simpson,Now I believe you.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, that's all gonna change, thanks to this tape..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"All right, Bob! Now it's personal!!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Back off, you servants of the Holy See!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Hel-lo?
0,Homer Simpson,"Goodbye, thanks for coming. If my party made you sick, tell your friends!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,This is going to be great!
0,Homer Simpson,Save my place.

1,Marge Simpson,"And yet, I miss America."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Whatever we did, we're sorry."
1,Marge Simpson,"Why did cavemen paint on walls? Why do you scratch your name on Tupperware? So when you die, something's left behind that says, ""I was here. I mattered. That's my Tupperware."""
1,Marge Simpson,"I want you to stop putting so much sugar in everything, or at least warn people that it's so unhealthy."
0,Homer Simpson,Writing's for nerds.

4,Milhouse Van Houten,We can't spare a single one!
8,Ned Flanders,you'll be hist...
0,Homer Simpson,I never realized how boring this game is.

0,Homer Simpson,"No! Ignore the boy, Lord. Now can the chatter and bow your heads. Dear Lord, thank you for this microwaved bounty, even though we don't deserve it.

7,Chief Wiggum,"That's 'cause it's not food, Ralphie!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom can't appreciate the kind of boy Nick is, because although I love Dad, he's a completely different creature."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, if they ever open the books on this telethon, I'm right back in there."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Fine, there's a Daddy Claus."
0,Homer Simpson,Thanks. Are you sure you don't want to come? In a Civil War reenactment we need lots of Indians to shoot.

1,Marge Simpson,Barney? W-w-where's Chad--
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, Mrs. K, I'm a Simpson. And a Simpson never gives up until he's tried at least one easy thing. Let me help you."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I'm not doing this for the money. I'm just happy knowing that future generations will enjoy unspoiled median strips and pristine highway embankments."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute. We all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. That's you, Flanders."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, leggo, you lousy, stinkin'..."
3,Bart Simpson,"Cowabunga, dude!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, I wouldn't mind driving that to the Holland, Michigan Tulip Festival."
1,Marge Simpson,That's not really what I was--
0,Homer Simpson,"Hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?"
1,Marge Simpson,Now I know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions. Like switching to the metric system...
0,Homer Simpson,"Even better, I never unpacked from the time we went to Hawaii."
0,Homer Simpson,Shot down on Valentine's Day. That's supposed to be a gimme. Everybody's gettin'some but me.
3,Bart Simpson,Salt of the earth.
1,Marge Simpson,Are Bees Building Hives In Your Diaper Genie?...
9,Moe Szyslak,"Homer, the mob is puttin' the screws on me, see. I ain't gettin' killed 'cause you won't pay your tab. Now give me fifty bucks!"
1,Marge Simpson,It's not up to you. We're going to take him to our moral and civic leaders. They'll know the right thing to do.
5,Lisa Simpson,That's alright. I think I'll just hit the hay.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Why indeed...
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, if you tell what I did, I'll get in trouble."
3,Bart Simpson,This ghost town is gonna be great. Now with 30 percent more gunfights!
0,Homer Simpson,But the note was asking you to --

0,Homer Simpson,"Good news, everybody. Because I endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want."
0,Homer Simpson,"This barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but I'm sure you're up to it, Marge."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hm, I'm not feelin' it."
0,Homer Simpson,"This is no time to pat the bunny, Maggie. Daddy's watching a very important Mid-Atlantic Hockey League Conference Semi-Final do-over game."
0,Homer Simpson,"It's true. The jar's empty. Oh, my God, we're ruined. Christmas is cancelled. No presents for anyone."
9,Moe Szyslak,You wanna stop calling me Mr. Moe?
5,Lisa Simpson,Fur is murder! When's the Krusty movie coming out?
0,Homer Simpson,"... Oh, hey, thank you, Maggie."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, yeah, a lot of people are doing that these days."
11,Seymour Skinner,How is that useful?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Here I am, walking the plank. I wish this mean pirate wasn't poking me with his sword! Where's the chimp?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Coolee, coolee cool! C'mon, fool! Be coolee, coolee cool!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Well, I'm not hangin' around for that."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay, it was me. I'm sorry I blew your secret. But you don't know what it's like to be a nobody. I just wanted to bask in your reflected glory. Reflected glory!"
0,Homer Simpson,I'll kill her after dessert!
5,Lisa Simpson,"I just think it's a fantasy. If you believe in angels, then why not unicorns, or sea monsters, or leprechauns?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Aww, I will treasure this forever."
5,Lisa Simpson,Suicide?!
0,Homer Simpson,How am I ever gonna take on all those guys?
3,Bart Simpson,How could you spend all our money on a comic published by Lens Crafters?
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, we've gotta get Buck and Tabitha back together. This is the most important case of our careers!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Ahh. Well, that was wonderful. A good time was had by all. I'm pooped."
0,Homer Simpson,"What the?! Well, he's more of a father to me than you've ever been."
3,Bart Simpson,Aha!
9,Moe Szyslak,I can't believe he acted completely in character.
1,Marge Simpson,"When I watched that pirated movie, I was stealing with my eyes. So I'm repaying the good people in Hollywood for the ticket I should have bought."
1,Marge Simpson,It's not a secret. It's a funny story.
0,Homer Simpson,Hm. Is it drinking and driving if you're flying a blimp? Maybe I can find the answer by texting.
1,Marge Simpson,Hm... needs more goat soul.
0,Homer Simpson,What day?
0,Homer Simpson,Saxa-ma-phone. Saxa-ma-phone.
3,Bart Simpson,What do you mean the bank is out of money? Insolvent?! You only have enough cash for the next three customers?!
8,Ned Flanders,That is the most dishonest thing I've ever heard.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"What about ""Colossal Salary Grab""?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Um, I don't know. I guess one person can make a difference, but most of the time, they probably shouldn't."
1,Marge Simpson,What? What is it?
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage."
0,Homer Simpson,Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! All you Yokos are out of the band!
3,Bart Simpson,Went to practice her Portuguese.
0,Homer Simpson,"You look at this table and what do you see? Just a table. Now, a creative person, like me, looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables."
3,Bart Simpson,It's an illusion.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Sure, we love it! But how can we watch TV when it's so beautiful out?"
0,Homer Simpson,I guess I always dreamed that my father would grow old alone.
5,Lisa Simpson,Did too.
1,Marge Simpson,That's nice.
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, we can trace where the kids are by the charges they made on your card. In Colorado, they charged two hundred dollars worth of bubble gum."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, this guy is awful."
3,Bart Simpson,"From then on, my life changed."
5,Lisa Simpson,A dog wrote a bestseller?! Aargh! All I've done is procrastinate! Who am I kidding? There will never be a book with my name on it.

1,Marge Simpson,It's on my apron.
9,Moe Szyslak,"How come you wanna do a report on me? I ain't no great man, like Bob Seger or Haystacks Calhoun."
0,Homer Simpson,My birthday?
1,Marge Simpson,"""You chat up the guard at the gate, while I knife the guard behind me."" I can't do that, Dwight."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, I think I got a Pai Gow!"
6,Grampa Simpson,Go home.
9,Moe Szyslak,"See? You're a pig. Barney's a pig. Larry's a pig. We're all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards."
6,Grampa Simpson,"You'll never take me alive, Grim Reaper!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Yeah, you guys don't want me there."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Homer, get outta here."
0,Homer Simpson,I have a soul and you guys don't!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, the President of Harvard would like a word with you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hi, Marge. It's me, Homer."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Okay, punching isn't your thing. But that's okay... you're not that kind of fighter. What you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from overpunching."
0,Homer Simpson,"This case is ""in the bag."""
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, no."
5,Lisa Simpson,I can read you like a book.
0,Homer Simpson,Oh. Thanks.

1,Marge Simpson,"Aren't you ready for church, Homer?"
5,Lisa Simpson,That didn't seem like a happy ending.
0,Homer Simpson,And it didn't cost us a dime.
0,Homer Simpson,Maybe this'll help.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I've missed moments like this... Mom."
1,Marge Simpson,"So Homer, fearing we would do the same, preemptively filed for divorce..."

0,Homer Simpson,"Mail call! Gather 'round, everyone!"
5,Lisa Simpson,You're out of tonic.
7,Chief Wiggum,Good food though.
1,Marge Simpson,...then take Bart to get C-I-R-C-U-M-C-I-S-E-D.
0,Homer Simpson,"Honey, it's me again. I can't work knowing that you're mad at me. I just wanna hear your voice. And I'm counting the minutes till the whistle blows, then I go to Moe's, then I rush home to you."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, Jessica, I don't think we should hang out together anymore. You're turning me into a criminal when all I want to be is a petty thug."
0,Homer Simpson,"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
9,Moe Szyslak,Ow! Ow! God help me!
5,Lisa Simpson,It's not a pedal boat. It's a pedal car that Bart drove into the river. Because he knows a shortcut that's not on the map.
0,Homer Simpson,Can I have a clean glass?
0,Homer Simpson,I... can't... breathe! Too... many... children...!
0,Homer Simpson,A CAMPING WE WILL GO...

3,Bart Simpson,Boogers.
0,Homer Simpson,Mmmm.
0,Homer Simpson,"I put you in humiliating commercials for money, which I spent on myself. I just wish I had an opportunity to make things right."
0,Homer Simpson,Water!
11,Seymour Skinner,"We're fine, then."
3,Bart Simpson,I'm sorry! I was faking it!
3,Bart Simpson,"I can't believe you, Grampa. The sergeant in that story you told would never be scared of a dork like Burns! You gotta get that treasure! You gotta do it for Ox and Asa and Griff and Burnsie... Well, not so much Burnsie."
11,Seymour Skinner,This is a great day for forbidden love.
1,Marge Simpson,"I've been so bored since we moved here, I've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. I know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but I just can't drink that much."
3,Bart Simpson,Get out! What's the catch?
1,Marge Simpson,Am I going too?
3,Bart Simpson,Did you give the money back to the people who lost it?

0,Homer Simpson,My corneas! You were saying?
1,Marge Simpson,The highest grade.
11,Seymour Skinner,To poor decisions.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, now lay off Detroit. Them people is living in Mad Max times. But I was thinking you could enter this bird in the annual Springfield to Shelbyville Birditarod. Hm?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Come on, we're leaving! Mmm, after one more mini-quiche..."
3,Bart Simpson,He sure did.
3,Bart Simpson,"I kinda think it's cool. Just pretend you're in a zombie movie. Besides, this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc."
3,Bart Simpson,RUBBING STICKS TOGETHER MAKES THE SPARKS IGNITE / AND THE THOUGHT OF LOVING YOU IS GETTIN' SO EXCITING...
8,Ned Flanders,"Uh, be careful there, Homer. That is sort of a new table."
0,Homer Simpson,"Exactly like Chandler, always criticizing."
0,Homer Simpson,I don't know what to believe anymore. Maybe it's time to call Satan. Is that a two-one-two?
6,Grampa Simpson,"I got me a date with Zelda, so I need the car."
0,Homer Simpson,"Gee, sorry, Dave."
0,Homer Simpson,Heyyyy.

2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Amazingly, the hamster's older than I am."

0,Homer Simpson,Yes! I can fly! See you back at the house!
5,Lisa Simpson,Santa must have left it.

3,Bart Simpson,"I can't promise you victory. I can't promise you good times, but the one thing I do know..."
3,Bart Simpson,"Fetch, boy!"
3,Bart Simpson,"No, I mean you're loco in the coco!"
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm sorry, Mom. I'll behave."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Instead of donating this money, I'm going to use it to extend my own life another ten minutes. Smithers?"
8,Ned Flanders,Hmm. I seem to have mashed more hair into it. Oh well.
1,Marge Simpson,And maybe you'll stop overeating too!
5,Lisa Simpson,Ew. How long has it been since you washed your stomach?
1,Marge Simpson,No. We can't start thinking that way about our own family members. Suspicion could tear us apart.
0,Homer Simpson,"I warn you: I don't know what's in there but if it's about a Simpson, you ain't gonna be proud."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, maybe it'll wear off. Like his interest in C.B. radio."
1,Marge Simpson,"People learn from their mistakes and your father made so many mistakes. And now, Patty and Selma are here to help us decorate with their new love-bots."
3,Bart Simpson,Note for later. Put rubber spider down Lisa's dress.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, so he could shoot it himself. Franklin Roosevelt led this country through the depression and World War Two!"
0,Homer Simpson,You mean?
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh honey, I can't believe this is happening. I'll miss you so much."

0,Homer Simpson,Will that hold up in court?
1,Marge Simpson,Where's your father with those pacifiers?
5,Lisa Simpson,You mean an increasingly difficult series of challenges to my intellect? That's so cool.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Wow, your mom has a job and my Dad still doesn't?"
1,Marge Simpson,"I made it with Cheetos, just like you like it. If the sauce is too thick, I can add more root beer."

0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, look who thinks he's smarter than sauce."
0,Homer Simpson,"What? It said ""take one."""
0,Homer Simpson,"But this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. And I'm going to get it back. Lisa, do I have my pants on?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"He crashed through the tree canopy there...and was presumably eaten by this cougar, who is still choking up parts of the boy's clothes."

0,Homer Simpson,"They're training our tigers, and kicking our extra points... These people are the glue that holds together the gears of our society."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, burrowing your head into your Daddy. A sign that my baby is happy and confident."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm just glad we're back to me being the father and you being the son."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'll be playing my first solo. If you miss it on Saturday, I'd advise you to start looking for a child therapist on Sunday."
3,Bart Simpson,"Me? Uh, I'm... Ahmed Adoody."
0,Homer Simpson,Mo-om! You're not looking!

5,Lisa Simpson,"In other words, to dodge the ball."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Uh, well sir, I uh..."
0,Homer Simpson,"A gun is not a weapon, Marge. It's a tool. Like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. You just need more education on the subject. Tell you what: you come with me to an NRA meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Elvis."
3,Bart Simpson,"I think I'm done here. Lisa, go nuts."

3,Bart Simpson,"Um, yes, I'd like to host an A.A. meeting. Tonight, if possible."

2,C. Montgomery Burns,But at least he won! The second time... assuming they don't find those ballot boxes in Ohio...
0,Homer Simpson,Marriage is so tough. Every second it could explode catastrophically. Makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.

8,Ned Flanders,I'm as real as the nose on your face.
0,Homer Simpson,"Apu? Manjula? Marge, I've got a bad feeling about this."

0,Homer Simpson,"Well, if it isn't the local school marm... and his new girlfriend. That's a burn on you, Flanders."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I bet he can't resist this."

0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I... uh..."

8,Ned Flanders,MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB / LITTLE LAMB / LITTLE LAMB...
3,Bart Simpson,"That might be a good idea, but then again, you thought it up. Eh, why not?"
0,Homer Simpson,I meant a week from tomorrow. That's when the new penis gets here.
0,Homer Simpson,Money in the bank.
9,Moe Szyslak,WHEN THEY ALL SHOULD LET US BE... WE BELONG TO YOU AND ME...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Listen, we can trade Mr. Teeny for Bart. We just have to find a way to get him up there."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine."

1,Marge Simpson,"Seems like animated shows are everywhere. Or were, last year."
9,Moe Szyslak,Can't we just pretend you're really a girl?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Wait, there's a commercial!"
1,Marge Simpson,You've saved more than a hundred dollars. I found it in your pants.
3,Bart Simpson,Uh oh! Who will save that poor fat man?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Your stuff is pretty disturbing.
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, head count. One, two, three, where's Maggie?!"

0,Homer Simpson,"But when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what I believe in."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hell no! To make you my new intern. You're a real go-getter. Now go get me my dry-cleaning, which is my code word for scotch, and get me my scotch, which is my code word for my bookie. Also, go get my dry-cleaning."

1,Marge Simpson,Take a look at this.
1,Marge Simpson,Dinner is served. I tried to make what Homer said you liked.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I make up words too. Anyway, I was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so I can be a hero to my boy again."
1,Marge Simpson,"It's just not a dinner party without a melon baller. And we'll need a citrus zester... a ravioli crimper... Ooh, an oyster mallet! ""Made in U.S.A.""? Eh, no thank you!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Yayyy!

0,Homer Simpson,You're right. What's this?
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot."
0,Homer Simpson,So get on the boat... the gravy boat.
11,Seymour Skinner,That smell takes me back.
0,Homer Simpson,What's happening? Did I crush your corporation?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Huh. Well, that was unexpected."
7,Chief Wiggum,Do you think there's anything great on NBC right now?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Uh, have the boys check into that."

0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, well, it all happened in 1990. Back then, the artist formerly known as Prince was currently known as Prince. Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. And Bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school..."

9,Moe Szyslak,"I'm a well-wisher, in that I don't wish you any specific harm."
1,Marge Simpson,I can't believe it. We won another contest!

1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't think it's in the cornstarch canister."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Oh! Ah, ah, that's painful."

1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, that Kojak is sexier than Cannon and Barnaby Jones put together. I think he looks a little like you."
5,Lisa Simpson,"They come to your home to help you raise independent, self-actualized children. The counselors can come day and night because they have no families themselves."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Eww, why is Courtney Love on the Wheaties box?"
3,Bart Simpson,It ain't over till the fat lady sings.

1,Marge Simpson,XL.
5,Lisa Simpson,Bart.
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, everything's perfect again."
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"

0,Homer Simpson,"Well, Mr. Cat Burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? There's just one little problem. Thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named Homer J. Sim -- Oh my God! Underage kids drinking beer without a permit!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"...And though Hiram, Mabel, and Eliza are no longer among us, their truth goes marching on. Thank you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, he does. All my life I've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. Mr. Burns has never given me a thumbs up or a ""way to be"" or a ""you go, girl."" No, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small."
8,Ned Flanders,"It's wonderful. I... I... I don't know how I can possibly repay you, but if any of you ever need a favor, just look for the happiest man in Springfield."
3,Bart Simpson,Are you sure you're okay?
10,Krusty the Clown,Why doesn't this material work for me?

3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, if Dad killed everyone he talked about killing, would any of us be here?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey boy, where'd you get that hat?"
3,Bart Simpson,"No, I fear the girls will laugh at me. I fear the boys will beat the living snot out of me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, maybe it was too soon."
3,Bart Simpson,"Actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity, I just might be able to hold on."
5,Lisa Simpson,"L'Ecole, c'est moi!"

10,Krusty the Clown,"And at the finish line -- a scrumptious parfait of pudding, pickle brine and detergent, where a writhing pile of kids will grope blindly for hot dogs."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ah, there's nothin' better than relaxin' with my favorite magazine."
0,Homer Simpson,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. Next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. There and there. Don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. Now, some aftershave."
0,Homer Simpson,No problem. I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.

0,Homer Simpson,"Man, you are a nutcracker. But I've learned something tonight: you know how everyone hates being with their family on Christmas? Well, being without them is worse. Can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break?"
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, that's it, pull over."
5,Lisa Simpson,But you don't play the piano.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hmm, I saw that report you did on Sasquatch. It was fair and evenhanded. I'll do it."

1,Marge Simpson,You said you'd be home by seven to help with my mother's birthday!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Now Sideshow Bob can't get in without me knowing. And once a man is in your home, anything you do to him is nice and legal."
3,Bart Simpson,That Sideshow Bob is a no-good showbiz phony.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"I won't, but these things have a way of getting out."

0,Homer Simpson,But not fat.
5,Lisa Simpson,Bart! There's something I need to tell you! Mom and Dad have been--

1,Marge Simpson,"Ohh, now Homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Aw jeez, I don't look like that."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Mayor Quimby?! Homer, why didn't you say you was with the mayor?"
0,Homer Simpson,Make sure it's squished flat and crunchy on the outside.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, who's that?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Sorry, Lis, I no longer control the hand. The hand controls me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Larry, my man!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Why, you clattering clank of.... My dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. D'oh the pain! D'oh the pain of it all!"

3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, Dad... I want to change schools!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, there's a dull ache, certainly. And overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. Only instead of bacon, there's agony. Marge, can I have a BLT?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Okay, you're ready to go. I've written down the basic commands so that anyone can understand them."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hurry, Mom! If we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone."
0,Homer Simpson,"But Marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good..."
1,Marge Simpson,How?
0,Homer Simpson,How's your Mom?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, all I wanted was to make obscene profits in the last year of my life and leave it to no one. Why does God hate dreamers?"
0,Homer Simpson,I have a plan.
3,Bart Simpson,I can't help it if Mom's workplace contains our TV.
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah. But what's gonna happen to the animals?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, quitcher bellyaching, coffee boy. You're lucky I let ya in here."

5,Lisa Simpson,Soyghetti-O's!
7,Chief Wiggum,Look at his nose!
0,Homer Simpson,That doesn't matter. The important thing is we won.
1,Marge Simpson,"Ah, that's my girl."
0,Homer Simpson,"The experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you should do it yourself first to show him how."
0,Homer Simpson,Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free!

3,Bart Simpson,Dad... I need help... Please...
1,Marge Simpson,"Very nicely said, Homer."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, no. What if they botch it? I won't have a dad... for a while."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, that's odd, because the consumer website says the RX-12 2-cylinder has a dealer's invoice of fourteen seven."
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm ending your vending, Dog."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Uh, excuse me, is this the seminar where you learn how to pick up free escorts?"

1,Marge Simpson,"No problem, I'll just drive up to your house and get it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Did you say ""ultimate Frisbee?"""
5,Lisa Simpson,"It's okay, but it's missing a piece."

0,Homer Simpson,Chief Wiggum! I remember seeing you...
6,Grampa Simpson,I'll answer that: your father's an idjit!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, sounds great. Maybe then you could afford to rent your own dumpster."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, I didn't lead her on. I always played it light and breezy."
11,Seymour Skinner,Maybe you'd like to give it a try?
5,Lisa Simpson,"A laser pointer! Thanks, Bart."
9,Moe Szyslak,We'll choose the same way they pick the Pope.

1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad, how come you're wearing a tuxedo?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, how come I get lice and nothing happens to Milhouse?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, this place is so big. Do you think we should split up and look for them, Homie? Homie?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Those are bedbugs!
10,Krusty the Clown,What the hell happened?!
1,Marge Simpson,Maybe I should come too.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"... Now, a few more details about this year's company picnic. It's at the plant, no food will be served, the only activity will be work, and the picnic is cancelled."
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't come off all high and mighty with me, Patterson. You can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, no-no-no-no, you don't understand. Bart's just my brother."
3,Bart Simpson,"I don't like wearing tights, ma'am."
0,Homer Simpson,"Milkshake Festival. Look, you can see the booths from your window."

0,Homer Simpson,"Ooo, gumball."
9,Moe Szyslak,Whaaa?
1,Marge Simpson,You were never going to apologize!
0,Homer Simpson,"But you're also the housekeeper, so it's all good."

3,Bart Simpson,Snowball II has another family!
1,Marge Simpson,"So, Renee, it looks like you've taken quite a shine to Moe. Do you mind if I ask why?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Aw, Lisa. You tried your best."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh really? Bart, when did you get your tenure?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I'll take two thousand.
1,Marge Simpson,"No, Artie, Artie. The best argument is that I've known and respected you for eight years, and I would be delighted to go to the prom with you."
5,Lisa Simpson,Just screwing with your mind.
3,Bart Simpson,Somebody must have voted.
5,Lisa Simpson,Nelson? He couldn't have made a movie by himself. Who helped him?
1,Marge Simpson,"This family has hit a new low. We're on the run from the law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes... And it's all your fault."
3,Bart Simpson,And then brag about it on the internet!
0,Homer Simpson,Gimme another one.
3,Bart Simpson,A nanny?!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Of all the kisses I've ever gotten in my life, that was the first."

3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait. I saw that Lost in Space movie. You are not Doctor Smith."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ned, Homie's a little cranky right now. More than his eye, I think you hurt his feelings."

0,Homer Simpson,Patty. Selma. I'm sorry.

10,Krusty the Clown,UH... You'll have to be way more specific.
1,Marge Simpson,Marcus?
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, there's my magazine. Why, look at this! ""What every father should do for his daughter."""
5,Lisa Simpson,What are you trying to say?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Stop doing that, Mom."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Juliet, I'm scared."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Mmm-hmm. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it's your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well, I say, cheating is the gift Man gives himself."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Ohh, Kent, that's a sad story."
6,Grampa Simpson,Wait. That's my hand.
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw, c'mon, Dad. Get on the trolley."
5,Lisa Simpson,"So, how are my little stone age tub dwellers? Oh my gosh!"

3,Bart Simpson,Really.
6,Grampa Simpson,That was one too man.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"I can't do it. I can't hurt you, Lisa!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Maggie, you can't climb into the TV. If you could, I'd make Alex Trebek answer some questions."
1,Marge Simpson,Yup. And I know a place that could use this smile.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, I got a bingo! What do I win?"
3,Bart Simpson,Not one word.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, Dad! Please, can I go here? I'll study so hard I'll make the old me look like Bart."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, turn down the heat. That's better."
8,Ned Flanders,"And Lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin.

5,Lisa Simpson,Sorry Bart.
3,Bart Simpson,Crap rock?
0,Homer Simpson,Krusty! How 'bout a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?
3,Bart Simpson,"Ma'am, whatever you do, do not marry that ape."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. I can't fill this out for you."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,That man is the perfect choice.
0,Homer Simpson,"Face it, Marge -- Catholics rule. We've got Boston, South America, the good part of Ireland, and we're making serious inroads in Mozambique, baby!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well this is very impressive, Lisa. I'm kicking this right onto the mantle."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm on my way!
11,Seymour Skinner,"And now, our evening comes to an end..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. But the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Ooh, you're a good eater today, Maggie."
3,Bart Simpson,"Didn't have to, I'm a dude."
1,Marge Simpson,Really? Like what?
0,Homer Simpson,I'll just focus on one area... How many did I get? None? That's cool.
5,Lisa Simpson,"That's Cameron. Girls go crazy over him. He's cute, unthreatening, and his smile brought a puppy back to life."
5,Lisa Simpson,Everyone in Springfield had a reason to shoot Mr. Burns. Even us.
3,Bart Simpson,"No, you shut up."
9,Moe Szyslak,Why did I advertise my drink specials in Scientific American?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"...a ""ski trip""."
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm not inferring anything. You infer. I imply.
1,Marge Simpson,"Raisin cake! Who wants raisin cake? Don't worry, it's not too moist!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"I know it's futile, but I must again point out there is no dragon."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Please let it be someone smart, motivated, and who won't just teach us corporate-sponsored lessons."
11,Seymour Skinner,Is Roxanne back?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Cheer up, Homer. Christmas is comin' early this year!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Not so fast, busboy!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"No, that's what he called me. Eh."
1,Marge Simpson,"Hello. I'm Marge. This is my husband Homer, my daughters Lisa and Maggie and my son -- Bart Simpson."
0,Homer Simpson,"Barney, I'm not getting a sex change!"
8,Ned Flanders,Ohhhhh.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Sure, sure. I understand. But if you change your minds, I'll be here in this cave."
0,Homer Simpson,"No one feels out a unit like CJ! Not Bubba, not Debbie and Danny, no one!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't drag me down with you, old man."
6,Grampa Simpson,OH-OH-OH-OH-OHHH. THE PAIN! THE PAIN!
0,Homer Simpson,This late? Through the bad neighborhood?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, best ever."
3,Bart Simpson,"But Dad, you're giving in to mob mentality."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, Homer! Stop doin' that!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I'll take him too.
0,Homer Simpson,"What if he started pieing good people? Not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"You don't have a ""whisper"" voice, do you?"
11,Seymour Skinner,That was the idea.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Send in Sugarbelle.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Wow, what a view."
1,Marge Simpson,"Isn't that a little excessive? I mean, how are the buttons dangerous?"
0,Homer Simpson,"You just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. In ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. Every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. And there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. And you blew her off."
3,Bart Simpson,I'll give a valentine to a loser. I'll give a valentine to a dork. I'll even give a valentine to a girl. But I won't give a valentine to a bully.
3,Bart Simpson,Do you have any giant squid? The kind that drags men to their deaths?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Hmm. His brand of gum--Doublemint. Trying to double your fun, eh, Bart? Well, I'll double your detention. I wish someone was around to hear that. And so we enter end game."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,That's exactly how I'll take it!
3,Bart Simpson,Why are we still grifting? The car's paid for. Doesn't that balance out the universe?
3,Bart Simpson,Hop on!
3,Bart Simpson,"Warm... no, cold... colder... Ice cold."
11,Seymour Skinner,Just think what we can buy with that money. History books that know how the Korean War came out. Math books that don't have that Base six crap in them.
11,Seymour Skinner,"I see. Well, we, uh, still have fifty-six minutes left. Any questions?"
1,Marge Simpson,Ohhhh. Here I am!
0,Homer Simpson,He loves it!
5,Lisa Simpson,This is a disgrace.
0,Homer Simpson,"Up-bup-bup-bup-bup, don't look!"

8,Ned Flanders,"Hidilly ho, Stanster."
0,Homer Simpson,"Mr. Smithers, our lives are awesome, thanks to you. And because I know you ""like your loafers light,"" I want to give something back."
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, if ""The Flintstones"" has taught us anything, it's that pelicans can be used to mix cement."
0,Homer Simpson,Can do. Now don't you worry about a thing.
3,Bart Simpson,I wanna show you I understand how you feel. And they say a picture's worth a thousand words:
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Let go of me! I'm innocent!
0,Homer Simpson,"Barney, how'd you like to sing for our group?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey! Hey! Sabu! Ah, I need another magnum of your best champagne, here, uh? And bring us the finest food you got, stuffed with the second finest."
0,Homer Simpson,Professor Pigskin told me to bet on the Raiders but they look awful.
5,Lisa Simpson,"That's nice, but maybe your Homecoming float should have something to do with college."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, get the door."

0,Homer Simpson,What?! That's not why I'm here!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Don't worry, I'm wearing my lucky rabbit's head."
1,Marge Simpson,"Here he is. This is where the... ""magic"" happens."
1,Marge Simpson,He's a good man and a good neighbor and you're drinking coffee from his mug right now.
3,Bart Simpson,You're not mad?
1,Marge Simpson,Kids. Tell me the truth. Am I no fun? Do I just nag all the time?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, you're right. You shouldn't be wasting your time with a low-life like me."
3,Bart Simpson,Um... with our minds?
1,Marge Simpson,It certainly is. Why don't you put down your gun and have a slice?
0,Homer Simpson,I could lick you all day long.
0,Homer Simpson,A ride on the Duff Blimp...
8,Ned Flanders,"Uh, knock what off, Simpson?"
0,Homer Simpson,I heard you the first five times.
3,Bart Simpson,"Good luck tonight, sis. I'll try not to hurt you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait, let's just leave it on till we forget our troubles."
3,Bart Simpson,"Listen... after I won, the website found out we were both under eighteen, so we're back to the original five thousand."
1,Marge Simpson,"All right. I'd like to sign my daughter up for lessons, Vicki."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oooh, oooh, Charlie horse, Charlie horse!"
1,Marge Simpson,So get that piece of paper!
10,Krusty the Clown,"IT'S FULL OF EXTRA FEATURES / AND DELETED SCENES / LIKE WHEN YOU FELL AND SPLIT YOUR PANTS / AND WE SAW YOUR ""FRANK AND BEANS."""
9,Moe Szyslak,"Please, not in public."

5,Lisa Simpson,Bart! That's tomorrow night's dinner.
0,Homer Simpson,...Debbie Pinson.
0,Homer Simpson,"See, I told you, it's not raining. So we're just homeless."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Don't you think there's something weird going on here? We spent all day selecting fabric swatches, and then our guest speaker was ""Phil from Marketing""."
3,Bart Simpson,Snow!
1,Marge Simpson,All I'm saying is don't get too comfortable. Mr. Burns will be back tomorrow.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, there's two surprises!"
6,Grampa Simpson,Just a quick game of hacky-sack.
3,Bart Simpson,"Ha-ha, they left without you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, Marge, you don't smoke!"
3,Bart Simpson,"...three, four, five, chance. Pick up a card."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge. We've got the power now. And you can't turn us off!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, we have no witnesses, no suspects and no leads. If anyone has any information please dial ""oh"" and ask for the police. That number again, ""oh."""
9,Moe Szyslak,"And now, as our teakettle starts to toot, I'm gonna take a little break. Boy, this voiceover thing is killin' me. Whatever that Don Pardo gets paid, it ain't enough."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, be fair Marge. For once in your life, be fair."
5,Lisa Simpson,Snowball II... Santa's Little Helper... this is Princess. Please don't exclude her because she's different.
3,Bart Simpson,Green Lantern!... nah.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Now, Johnny, whatcha got for us. Jokes -- a little magic?"
1,Marge Simpson,Then that's what I'm gonna do.
5,Lisa Simpson,So typical of Bart. All he thinks about is himself.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Eh, long story."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh, yeah? Well that makes two of us."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I really wanted to do that one."
1,Marge Simpson,Since then I haven't been able to do any of the calculus I've encountered in my daily life. But that's not going to happen to you.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, did you have something to do with this?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm ready to punch in."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh yeah. How is old Grimey?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmmm... no books, no radio, no board games. Ah! A Bazooka Joe comic."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, why don't you do something about it?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Sorry, Bart. I'd love to help you but I'm mired in Stage Five, self-pity."
0,Homer Simpson,Go away. Eating.
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's see... ""The price of stamps will climb ever higher."""
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Well surely you agree we can do without her.
5,Lisa Simpson,It's my favorite!

1,Marge Simpson,"Hmm, it's actually more of a honey glaze --"
0,Homer Simpson,"Eh, that wasn't so bad."
3,Bart Simpson,Sure we can. But let me go first. Everyone knows you're the future of this family.
0,Homer Simpson,He took Bart too?
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, a friendly bee."
0,Homer Simpson,"Kill myself? Killing myself is the last thing I'd ever do. Now I have a purpose, a reason to live. I don't care who I have to face. I don't care who I have to fight. I will not rest until this street gets a stop sign."
9,Moe Szyslak,"I, I, I tuned out. Where we goin'?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I don't think you're my type."
0,Homer Simpson,I have to Marge. Who else is gonna keep oil under a hundred dollars a barrel?
0,Homer Simpson,"Not just the laundry... That would be weird, and you might ask questions. I wanna do all the chores!"
0,Homer Simpson,I'm gonna write the best darn article... Oh wait.
7,Chief Wiggum,Whaaa?! Let me see that.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, Homer! I hope Crusher and Low Blow didn't hurt you."
1,Marge Simpson,"Sweetie, maybe it's time you retired from paparazzing. It's never fun to get a taste of your own medicine."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, the templates had a great run. But we'd like our hair to look like um... people hair."
0,Homer Simpson,"Come on, you can't look at that infinitely dense little guy and not want to feed it something!"
3,Bart Simpson,"I'll sludge you, you old bat."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, Simpson, your love of food is contagious."
0,Homer Simpson,"Say, who are you guys?"
0,Homer Simpson,Is...
0,Homer Simpson,True -- but there's room for the truth in this household. Do you wanna hear something really bad Kent told me about the Fox network?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Sure, that's all you men do is, take and take and take, without regard to feelings or unicorns...here, take my lunch, too!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Ay caramba, que mujer tonta! Veinte horas estudiar por nada!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Welcome to the jungle, Kevin!"
1,Marge Simpson,The cure to any man's problems is a good relationship.
0,Homer Simpson,Do you get time off for snitching on your cellmates?
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, maybe if you go..."
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, hello! It's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night."
3,Bart Simpson,Teamsters are sleeping in my room.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Gas station customer washing windshield without buying gas... girl using White-Out as nail polish... Oh man, this is hard."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, well, well! Our dashing young junior executive! You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"When I made you a hoop you split your pants! Now here at the plant there's no position more important than our accounts man, who's responsible for glad-handing our customers and suppliers. I'd like you to take over that position."
3,Bart Simpson,Fifteen-ninety-eight...
8,Ned Flanders,The Flanders family has pulled up stakes. You have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.
0,Homer Simpson,"Thanks, that means a lot to me."
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh, no! This isn't a devine miracle. Everyone's just gettin' goofy from the gas."
1,Marge Simpson,Thirty dollars will be fine.
8,Ned Flanders,"Hm, maybe there is something in there."
1,Marge Simpson,"Hang on, Homie. I'm gonna try to set her down."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Get this bear off...
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!"
3,Bart Simpson,There's a reason.
3,Bart Simpson,Cartoons have writers?
1,Marge Simpson,We saved fifty cents on that purchase!
0,Homer Simpson,"Yep, a machine."
3,Bart Simpson,But how? We would need the ultimate chill-out song.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Look, we can't fall into old patterns. We've gotta think of a plan."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome employees! ""Come in!"" ""The whole night's entertainment is on me"" -- ""Monty Burns!"""
0,Homer Simpson,We're gonna go see Marmaduke?
3,Bart Simpson,"The truth is, there was no wolf. I faked the whole thing. I'm just going to lie on the floor now. Please don't let me swallow my tongue."
0,Homer Simpson,Your kisses feel like raw liver.
5,Lisa Simpson,This is the best hiding place. They'll never find me.
1,Marge Simpson,"On Main Street, turn right now... / Our Sunday drive is ruined! Hands at ten and two!"
9,Moe Szyslak,Edelbrock intakes...
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, you were nuts."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, the glue will slow me down."
0,Homer Simpson,"Of course. I mean, how long could it be?"
0,Homer Simpson,"What do you think, sweetie?"
3,Bart Simpson,Don't-really-care-just-terribly-caught-up-in-moment!
1,Marge Simpson,"Uh... ooh, ooh, it's lovely. I like this part in here... the way it, um, it goes."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well done Bart, but in Brazil they speak Portuguese."
8,Ned Flanders,Let's see what else is on.
3,Bart Simpson,"Nash, I've realized something. I'm the worst kid in the world, and the last thing I deserve is forgiveness. But with a little help from Jesus and our fighting men and women overseas--"
0,Homer Simpson,Every time I try to fix things it just makes things worse. But I'm gonna fix this!
1,Marge Simpson,That's even worse. Could you say it one more time?
0,Homer Simpson,... Show you...
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, guys. Something always comes along to save us."
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, steady Bart. Taking ballet doesn't make you any less of a man."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"So the good news is, church revenues are up one thousand and seventy-three percent."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, when does the exercise start?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, I saw him playing in the water, and then he was gone. He had a bright red leash, with bells on it."
1,Marge Simpson,How could you not tell me this is an erotic bakery?!
10,Krusty the Clown,"I have dinner with all my employees, right Sideshow Mel?"
0,Homer Simpson,Your king needs these stilts!
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes! Yes! In your face, losers! This helicopter is taking off!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, and I suppose you do?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Here, esquilax."
11,Seymour Skinner,Muddy footprints on the school floor.
5,Lisa Simpson,Let's see... It's like when you watch old home movies of you watching TV.
10,Krusty the Clown,All the time. Except when I'm at the track. Then it's all business.
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, honey. I found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where."
0,Homer Simpson,Why you little --
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, even Milhouse has a cell phone! Your son is lamer than Milhouse! What does that say about you?!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh man, what's this bite gonna do? My wrists are tingling... I feel new powers surging within me..."
1,Marge Simpson,A mixer? I don't know -- I am still technically married...
0,Homer Simpson,"Good night, son."
3,Bart Simpson,"Nah, it's too early. I need to work under cover of darkness."
9,Moe Szyslak,Yes! We win again!
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, can we please find Bart?"
1,Marge Simpson,Take 'em off the glass! Take 'em off the glass!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Um, when a woman talks, she just wants to be heard."
1,Marge Simpson,I thought I had one of those chirping keys.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Come on, shampoo! You can do it!"
1,Marge Simpson,I don't want a comedian knowing my dress size!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Now you are the one who is ""it."""
0,Homer Simpson,"Well friend, you're going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders' house."
0,Homer Simpson,Pedestrian.
3,Bart Simpson,Nelson's a great quarterback. He's carryin' this team!
0,Homer Simpson,"That's it, Marge, he knows the whole hot dog song. Go ahead, sleep with him. I'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by."
0,Homer Simpson,Fine. But the bacon man lives in a bacon house!
1,Marge Simpson,You forgot the special lunches I made.
1,Marge Simpson,I'm so glad you two are friends again.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of ""booger man,"" but I'm really not such a bad ""dude."" Oh, your milk's gone cold. I'll ring for the maid."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Step over this line and say that. I'll kick your butt. At Nintendo.
9,Moe Szyslak,This says I ain't allergic to pollen. So I could'a gone to the park and played with other kids. I gotta make up for lost time!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yoo-- think you're pretty hot, eh? Well, we've got everything we need on you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Mr. Scorpio says productivity is up 2%, and it's all because of my motivational techniques, like donuts and the possibility of more donuts to come."
7,Chief Wiggum,"You're under arrest, slimebag. What's this perp in for, Lou?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Meanwhile, the group was having problems of its own..."
3,Bart Simpson,But what happens to our parents?
0,Homer Simpson,"You're on! Lisa, you play winner."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, are you becoming a muncher?"
8,Ned Flanders,"No, I-I came to talk to you about your potty-mouth."
5,Lisa Simpson,There are so many worse crimes. Why are you persecuting me?
0,Homer Simpson,I think Ned is gonna be all right...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ew, your arm! It's got extra corners!"
1,Marge Simpson,Can you at least put it in your jacket?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh! Mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage I've ever seen. And it's not easy for me to say that."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Too old! Why that just means I have experience. Who chased the Irish out of Springfield Village in ought four? Me, that's who!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Boy, you make it look effortless. And that kid's giving you zero pump."
3,Bart Simpson,Easiest money I ever...
5,Lisa Simpson,That's right. A girl wants to play football. How about that?
0,Homer Simpson,Love you.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah. Another day, another box of stolen pens."
0,Homer Simpson,Tights? Robes? This stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady.

0,Homer Simpson,Mamma mia! Now I'll have to do it.
0,Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Moe. How can I ever repay you?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Thank you for coming on such short notice, Ms. Botz."

5,Lisa Simpson,I don't want to make the team.
0,Homer Simpson,"Not a word, Marge. I'm heading straight for the tub."
0,Homer Simpson,What an age we live in.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Laddie saved the day, Simpson. Boy, we sure could use a dog like that on the force."
1,Marge Simpson,Our water was on fire!
0,Homer Simpson,Go to hell!
3,Bart Simpson,You mean the wild mood swings?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Mom, let's take it for a test drive."

5,Lisa Simpson,I'm going to have my wedding here.
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, I'll do the dishes when I pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. See, there it is. But that was a practice. The system works!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Goodnight, broom. Good night jukebox that won't play a tune."
5,Lisa Simpson,This is where I live.
3,Bart Simpson,"No, I'm not."
1,Marge Simpson,I'm afraid so.
5,Lisa Simpson,Can we do it this week?
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! Stop teasing!
0,Homer Simpson,No! I'm giving them a foot massage. At least let me have that.

0,Homer Simpson,EVERYTHING IS A SOURCE OF FUN...
1,Marge Simpson,Here's a ten. Make your own card.
1,Marge Simpson,I'll just use Homer's Triple A card.
5,Lisa Simpson,What about that sign right there?
0,Homer Simpson,Plemk heh feh.
3,Bart Simpson,"You expect me to believe all this? If any of it was true, wouldn't I have a big, hideous scar..."

10,Krusty the Clown,I thought I'd get into shape so I've been drinking nothing but milkshakes.
3,Bart Simpson,Um... I've gotta go.
0,Homer Simpson,"It's not exactly fun and games for me either, Marge."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Yeah, but you say it first."
5,Lisa Simpson,Can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"What is it, Bart?"
3,Bart Simpson,"I just don't want to be here, Dad. Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on."

3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, I promise."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Sadly, no."
3,Bart Simpson,You can't make us come down.
7,Chief Wiggum,Yeah. It's cheaper than blank tape.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's beautiful! Oh! Oh, let's put Bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!"

0,Homer Simpson,Hey? How did I get out here?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Look at that man. He has the crowd in the palm of his hand. Haven't seen anything like it since Jolson. Who is he?
0,Homer Simpson,"How about you, Barney?"
1,Marge Simpson,I knew this weekend was just an excuse to get in my mouth. Keep your money. I'm going home.
9,Moe Szyslak,"I need a brilliant new poem for the farewell dinner. So if you could turn these into one of those and then don't say nothin' while I take all the credit, I'd really appreciate it, though I'd never admit that. And look, I got you started. Eh? Eh?"
1,Marge Simpson,Here she comes! And-a one and-a two and-a...

3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, I think I can squeeze through that vent."
0,Homer Simpson,See? These are our bug-out bags. In here is everything we need to survive.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, it's a lot less dangerous than you think. You can see me do it again in a talent show next week."
1,Marge Simpson,"No! No, no, no! It was me that couldn't get to--"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"A plant employee carrying on like an oversexed orangutan in heat! This is a family nuclear-power plant, Simpson. Our research indicates that over 50 percent of our power is used by women. I will not have you offending my customers with your bawdy shenanigans!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will."
0,Homer Simpson,"Kids, this is the holiest night of the year. Tomorrow is Father's Day, and that makes tonight Father's Day Eve."

5,Lisa Simpson,What's this key with the plastic skull for?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Aw, that's okay, Barn."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Scum, Freezebag! I mean, freeze, scumbag! You can't write stuff like that. See that's why sitcoms are dying."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, it does work!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"... here at the plant without increasing the cost to the consumer, or affecting management pay raises. However, for you semi-skilled workers, there will be no Christmas bonuses."
8,Ned Flanders,"Sour ball, take me away!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"That's right. All his talk of peace and love is really honking off my red Chinese masters. Now Smithers, walk me around the park until I fall asleep. I'm feeling fussy."
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, I know a song that will cheer you up. THERE ONCE WAS AN UGLY DUCKLING..."
7,Chief Wiggum,That's nice work with the bag-zooka.
1,Marge Simpson,I just got a message from Maggie in my brain.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I was wondering. Do you think you could babysit the kids this weekend? I wouldn't ask, except I'm desperate."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Let's get really far ahead on our homework! Wait 'til the other kids see we're already on the red unit of ""Adventures In Reading."""

3,Bart Simpson,"Tomato, tomato."
0,Homer Simpson,That's right. See that ship over there?

3,Bart Simpson,Bye-bye toothbrush.
3,Bart Simpson,We brought you breakfast in bed!
0,Homer Simpson,"The problem is, you don't share my interest in not being with you."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"... and, ""Goodbye!"" You're fired!"

0,Homer Simpson,"Ahh, you got lucky, Flanders! And fix that hat!"
6,Grampa Simpson,"What is it, a Unitarian?"
0,Homer Simpson,"This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That's what got me so mad in the first place."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Now kids, I want you to go to your parents' medicine cabinet and find all the pills labeled Lithium Dibromide...and send them to me -- now! No one likes a bi-polar clown."
3,Bart Simpson,Can't anybody enjoy their forever vacation!?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, don't look."
6,Grampa Simpson,I got a bite!
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, there's bound to be some splashback."

0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well I have full tenure."
0,Homer Simpson,Whew. All that seizing made me hungry.
6,Grampa Simpson,Don't answer it yet -- savor the sound.
3,Bart Simpson,Funniest man alive? Prince of Pies? The Sultan of Seltzer?
1,Marge Simpson,We can talk about that after brunch with my mother.
1,Marge Simpson,No! You should never raise your hand to a child. Just leave the crust on their sandwiches. They'll get the message.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well technically since she's paying for the room, she brought me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Maybe it's time for a visit from Wally, the Kissing Walrus."
11,Seymour Skinner,We're gonna have to give this some thought.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Geez, this hot-rod is souped up six ways from Sunday. Never had you figured for a gear-head, Homer."
0,Homer Simpson,Mmmm--
0,Homer Simpson,I know -- I'll use that white-noise machine I got you when your father died.
0,Homer Simpson,Marge is right -- the Rapture isn't coming! There haven't been any ominous signs!
8,Ned Flanders,"Okay Simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause I think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun."
5,Lisa Simpson,Now you can't tell me nicotine's not addictive.
0,Homer Simpson,"Dad, what are you doin' here?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer."

0,Homer Simpson,"I don't want to alarm you, Marge..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Chief, this is just a big misunderstanding. I meant to write ""bride."" It's a wedding present."
9,Moe Szyslak,"But, can you blame me? Every day it's the same old routine. I serve you drinks, you yak on and on and on, and I never get one stinkin' tip."
8,Ned Flanders,"So, uh, uh, where's your band?"
8,Ned Flanders,"And so we don't have another disaster, you crawl up those steps!"

2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, we've managed to stave off cabin fever for a few hours."
5,Lisa Simpson,Wait! Haven't you learned a lesson here? Over-fishing and greed have brought this town nothing but rack and ruin.

5,Lisa Simpson,Candy Warhol? Xavier Nougat?
3,Bart Simpson,Hey wait a minute. That was the same day he was at Ticonderoga. How could he be in two places at once?
1,Marge Simpson,Oh my!
5,Lisa Simpson,But I'm a real tightwad. Can I afford this remarkable system?
3,Bart Simpson,"Greta, I'm sorry I didn't handle the breakup well. But you're a sweet kid and some day you'll find someone who..."

0,Homer Simpson,Now we wait for the river to freeze. If my theory of global cooling is correct.
5,Lisa Simpson,Bart won a blue ribbon... but was it worth it?
1,Marge Simpson,Your country doesn't think illegally downloaded movies is wrong.
0,Homer Simpson,Someday you'll understand that I'm just being a good dad.
3,Bart Simpson,You're not wearin' a kilt.

11,Seymour Skinner,Nelson?
0,Homer Simpson,Give me back my newspaper!
0,Homer Simpson,I've never been so miserable in all my life. But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids. I've got to carry the burden all by myself.

0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I don't know about this dog. He's kinda... snooty."
3,Bart Simpson,But I heard a woman scream.
5,Lisa Simpson,Excuse me? I think this fell off your hat.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,You wouldn't dare hurt me! You forget that I have... THE GLASSES!
3,Bart Simpson,"Ah, Action News, the last place an impressionable kid can go for TV violence."
5,Lisa Simpson,"But what liberal really means, is someone who believes that those who have more than enough should share a little with those who don't."
1,Marge Simpson,"Sometimes I think he's more interested in his ""Itchy and Mitchy"" cartoons than me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but I have one more question: did you sleep with Kirk Van Houten?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Uh, well we only have the manpower to enforce the last law passed. Y'know, it's not the best system... but, well in fact, it's uh, it's pretty much the worst."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Mrs. Simpson, Bart has always been what we educators term a ""Nogoodnik,"" but lately his behavior has taken a more sinister turn."

9,Moe Szyslak,Ow! Ow! Ow! Now why would you wear cleats to a store?
0,Homer Simpson,Leave me alone! I have shares to crop!
11,Seymour Skinner,"But, as a one-time occurrence, no cause for alarm."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, it's really comin' down out there."
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, yeah, me. I use it all the time."
0,Homer Simpson,Dynamite?! They are terrorists! Must leave quietly.
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh, no. The Springfield Mall."
5,Lisa Simpson,Why would you want to banish us from Springfield?
3,Bart Simpson,I'm gonna swim nekkid.
6,Grampa Simpson,All these years I thought you loved that dog more than me.

1,Marge Simpson,Are your parents okay with that? They've never met us.
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, I don't know. You gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay sweetie, which book should I read?"
5,Lisa Simpson,How much?
5,Lisa Simpson,I never wanna go back to that mall. There were eels in the photo booth!
1,Marge Simpson,No answer. Let's go find your father.
9,Moe Szyslak,Is what I'll say tomorrow morning!
5,Lisa Simpson,Pong!
0,Homer Simpson,You too. No goose bumps. No hallucinations. That last time was just a fluke.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"No, he's a bit listless, isn't he? Give me... Ooh, that spirited fellow..."
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm sure she'd be happier without someone sitting on her back all day.
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't feel bad, boy. Everyone makes mistakes. Yours is just public and expensive."
0,Homer Simpson,"Actually, I didn't see it, but on the poster it..."
3,Bart Simpson,Excuse me. Can you tell us what kind of birds these are? They hatched from eggs I found in a nest.
0,Homer Simpson,It is. It is. But first let me introduce you to my family. My perfect family.
3,Bart Simpson,"You just don't get it. I've made a sacred commitment to the Catholic church, and... paintball! Awesome!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, wait! I smell hamburgers too."
5,Lisa Simpson,Wow! My mother the actress. I feel like Lucie Arnaz-Luckinbill.
3,Bart Simpson,Hey -- you licked the back! That was my side!
11,Seymour Skinner,And now the reason we're all here today... Lisa Simpson!
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm gonna treat Marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, gee, Marge."
0,Homer Simpson,Compliments of the deacon!
9,Moe Szyslak,"You know, a couple weeks ago I wouldn't have minded if you shot me. But all that's changed, because of this little girl here. Look at her. Ain't she a doll?"
0,Homer Simpson,I pity those poor suckers on the freeway. Gas-brake-honk. Gas-brake-honk. Honk-honk-punch. Gas-gas-gas.
0,Homer Simpson,Useless? This flash cube has two flashes left!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah-ha, big mistake pal! I knew he'd slip up sooner or later."
3,Bart Simpson,"Damn, this ride is pimped-out."
0,Homer Simpson,"Then I now pronounce us ""just dating."""
3,Bart Simpson,"Not from me, you didn't."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, ain't that somethin'."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Listen Homer, uh... would you like to see my uh, my favorite place in the whole world?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, that was fifty already?"
3,Bart Simpson,Dad! The fish!
5,Lisa Simpson,If anyone wants me I'll be in my room.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Good news, bad news. We're allowed to select the judge, but it's impossible to find one who doesn't hate you..."
5,Lisa Simpson,Speak.
0,Homer Simpson,That's a story for another day.
0,Homer Simpson,Text me the choices.
5,Lisa Simpson,It worked! They're all dead!
0,Homer Simpson,We have a kitchen?!
0,Homer Simpson,"Creepy? Marge, the apocalypse is coming. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming... and soon."
5,Lisa Simpson,You're group-writing a book?! But the only reason anyone would ever do that is... profit!
3,Bart Simpson,"Sorry Mom, but this is the Catholic church. Chicks don't have any authority here."
3,Bart Simpson,Time to blow up the clown...
11,Seymour Skinner,"People, please. It's a school night."
1,Marge Simpson,Thatta boy.
0,Homer Simpson,I don't wanna!

0,Homer Simpson,"Brilliant... exquisite ...ooh, you'll do well... Gimme those, etc."
6,Grampa Simpson,"If he's out, can I move back in?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Even if we sell the house, we still won't come close to paying off the mortgage."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Car what? Car is the subject, but I don't know the verb!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, but you hold onto the big things! The point is, the more I got to know you, the more I got to like you."

10,Krusty the Clown,I gotta steal that bit.
3,Bart Simpson,I thought we were caroling.
10,Krusty the Clown,"It's all a part of our Krusty Burger Olympic Sweepstakes. Just scratch off the name of the Olympic event on your gamecard... and if America wins a gold medal, you win a free Krustyburger!"
1,Marge Simpson,That's Mary Had a Little Lamb.
5,Lisa Simpson,It's gonna kill you!
9,Moe Szyslak,"It's too late -- I don't got the cash to clean up the bar. From now on, you guys are gonna hafta do your drinking across the street."

3,Bart Simpson,"All right, then to decide it, I propose a race around the world. Meet me at Luster Square at noon tomorrow. The queen herself shall drop the checkered flag."
0,Homer Simpson,You're mean!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, you'll never get Krabappel and Skinner together again. They're like two positively charged ions."

1,Marge Simpson,"For our first game, I need everyone to draw a picture of President Eisenhower."
10,Krusty the Clown,"What about a comedy candle? You know, that relights itself?"
0,Homer Simpson,Good night.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Me too!
3,Bart Simpson,"I dunno. But in ten minutes I'm gonna have him kneeling before Zod. In this example, I'm Zod."

0,Homer Simpson,Bust my hump all week... stupid grass... supposed to be the boy's job.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's more like it! ""OH, I WANT TO BE IN THAT RUMBA / WHEN THE SAINTS GO OVER THERE.... OVER THERE... OVER THERE."""
1,Marge Simpson,"Maybe instead of watching TV with the kids, you could take them outside and... what are you doing?"
1,Marge Simpson,Where's it from?
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer, please. You're embarrassing yourself."
0,Homer Simpson,You made it! Did you have any trouble getting past the security guards?
9,Moe Szyslak,Uh... it would have to be somebody famous... I'm gonna say Hitler?
3,Bart Simpson,How is fur murder? They're just animals.
1,Marge Simpson,"And a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk, just like this."
3,Bart Simpson,The whole insides.
3,Bart Simpson,"Or, time to walk away from the table."
0,Homer Simpson,"Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we're not talking about food."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, I'd like to send this letter to the Prussian consulate in Siam by aero-mail. Am I too late for the 4:30 auto-gyro?"
10,Krusty the Clown,Let me say I was the first clown to put a woman in sketches. Miss Bada Boom Boom Boom! She had more acting talent in one boob than most women have in their entire rack.

1,Marge Simpson,I thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
3,Bart Simpson,"I just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp. Can I say ""crappy"" on TV?"
0,Homer Simpson,I hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?
7,Chief Wiggum,Don't worry. Your yellow-bellied ratting will be held in the strictest confidence.
0,Homer Simpson,"If I'm gonna tell that woman the truth, I'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad."
3,Bart Simpson,Three.
6,Grampa Simpson,"We're having a great time. I cleaned up all my best war stories for her! I told her how we chased the ""Teddy bears"" into their cuddle-bunkers, then had to tickle them out with machine-hugs and fun-throwers. They say the more soldiers you tickle, the easier it gets. Well sir, it doesn't."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, eh? Good man? Intelligent?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Now, for a practical demonstration. First we load the ordnance...then select the target."

0,Homer Simpson,You gotta be kiddin'.
3,Bart Simpson,"Now, listen up. When I come back tomorrow you'd better have cowboy suits. And they'd better be adorable."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,This is where I come to cry.
0,Homer Simpson,Blue pants power!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Stay back, Homer! Approach no further. Coffee's already made. I stomped the beans myself."

3,Bart Simpson,Devon and Quenly?
0,Homer Simpson,"Agreed, but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture."
5,Lisa Simpson,Why is it playing over again?
1,Marge Simpson,I don't understand this. Why can't you stay with your parents?

0,Homer Simpson,"And that's good! But, here's the bad part... uh... uh... Ooh, look at that headline: ""Canada To Hold Referendum."" Sorry Marge, can't talk now."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Okay, I think we've been polite long enough here. Lenny, what happened with the dame and the bathing suit?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Attention, everyone."
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't look back, Marge. Don't look back."
1,Marge Simpson,That's okay. I...
3,Bart Simpson,"No way are you gonna to beat me this time, Lis!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'll come right out and help you."
3,Bart Simpson,"So, your honor, if you're going to punish anyone in this courtroom today, I ask that you punish me."
0,Homer Simpson,I'll show you.
9,Moe Szyslak,"If I couldn't spend the treasure on Edner, I didn't want to spend it. I just sat there playin' our song on the jukebox. One gold--"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey Homer, do fries come with that shake?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"So tell me, why don't you recoil from the public like a normal billionaire?"
0,Homer Simpson,Can't we go home yet? My feet hurt. All this fresh air is making my hair move. And I don't know how much longer I can complain.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Okay, here's the plan. This model car represents my car, huh? And this olive is you. Now..."
0,Homer Simpson,No! I can't lose my mother again! Don't take her away!
7,Chief Wiggum,It is my privilege to welcome this fine group of animals into the Springfield police force.

0,Homer Simpson,That's a great idea. We'll swim in the ocean.

3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I know he seems to get dumber every year, but lately he's plateaued."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Otto. Hey, Ottoman."
3,Bart Simpson,"So this is setting the table. If I'd known how easy this was, I'd have just done it instead of throwing all those tantrums."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, I know a little place."
1,Marge Simpson,"This was a lovely idea, Homie. Come here and kiss me."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, instead of milk for dinner, can I have a ""Virgin Moe?"""

0,Homer Simpson,And that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.
10,Krusty the Clown,"And the best part is when you come to Kamp Krusty, you'll spend the summer with me. Honest Injun!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Not bad. We had pizza, cake, and then sang songs with Nelson's Gramma. But, it was a one-time thing, and now I'll never see him again."
3,Bart Simpson,This is it... I finally get to accept an award for my movie...except it's not just my movie. It was my sister's idea to make this into a short. And so many animators... every day was somebody's birthday. And you know what? It was my Dad's movie too. I only wish he were here and not at Cerritos Auto Square.
0,Homer Simpson,You monster! What have you done to my face?!
0,Homer Simpson,Yes. We'll be back by three. Homer has a very tight nap schedule.

0,Homer Simpson,"Eat gravel, hags!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Awww. / Oh, no."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Maggie, time for your nine a.m. feeding."
1,Marge Simpson,"No, no, no! We want plane tickets home to Springfield."
11,Seymour Skinner,"I know Weinstein's parents were upset, Superintendent, but, but ah, I was sure it was a phony excuse. I mean, it sounds so made up: ""Yom Kip-pur?"""
3,Bart Simpson,This isn't real money. It's printed by the Montana Militia.
3,Bart Simpson,Clumsy Homer... Everything's always my fault... If he'd just watch where he was going...
0,Homer Simpson,I live to give.
3,Bart Simpson,Maybe it's the TV.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Be right there."
0,Homer Simpson,The Isotopes are winning? To the bandwagon!
0,Homer Simpson,What cool kid thing's in here?
0,Homer Simpson,Ah! Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. Holy moly! Nine-thirty.

1,Marge Simpson,"Don't listen to them, Maggie. Maggie?"
0,Homer Simpson,Fading... Rising!
5,Lisa Simpson,He wants to know your name.
0,Homer Simpson,"Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ah, excuse me? Isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it?"
1,Marge Simpson,This should be very educational. I want you kids to pay attention.
3,Bart Simpson,Did I?
0,Homer Simpson,"Resident... occupant... I can't open these. Ooh, a traffic ticket!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Garbage! What matchbook art school did you flunk out of, you ham-fisted, nearsighted house painter? Smithers, throw this on the dung heap."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Look Maggie, it's a pop up! ""Daddy's made a shiv. Can you help him ice Johnny Shakes, the jailhouse stoolie?"""
3,Bart Simpson,Then I'll just stick by you in secret. Like a sockmaker secretly working on a top secret sock that...
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm collecting signatures to bring back the night sky.
1,Marge Simpson,I wonder why Bart and Lisa are so late getting home from school?
1,Marge Simpson,Are you sure it's a Federal law that I have to dance with you?

3,Bart Simpson,He's crawling on your arm.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, I had to sell the trigger and most of the handle to feed my family. C'mon, give me the dough. I can throw this pretty hard."
0,Homer Simpson,I will! Edamame?
11,Seymour Skinner,"We want ten percent of the first-dollar gross, full European distribution rights, and access to the most exclusive VIP tent in Sundance."
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw, come on, Dad. Get the lead out."
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, come here and listen to Lisa's story. It's about Moe's treasure!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, I know I've been a little hard on you the last couple of days. If I had the strength to lift my arms, I'd give you a hug."
3,Bart Simpson,That swarm of nerds is gonna kill him!
1,Marge Simpson,"President of the union! I'm so proud of you, Homie."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Now, let Dr. Moe cure what ails you."
11,Seymour Skinner,The Skin-man doesn't give up that easily.

8,Ned Flanders,Does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church?
8,Ned Flanders,"Uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? Anyone like a draft beer?"
0,Homer Simpson,Don't dump me out! I can lose weight! Just give me a chance.
5,Lisa Simpson,Now you've done it. You really humiliated Mom.
3,Bart Simpson,Prove it. Using examples from this room.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, stomach churning... Bowels clenching... Not much time. Must finish."
1,Marge Simpson,"You got a letter too, Bart."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. But you know what? At least I'm out there trying new things. If it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, well I I almost fainted, but then I didn't. What are you doing?"
1,Marge Simpson,Why are you always trying to cause trouble with me and Homer? Our marriage is rock solid!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, you have to take him back!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, Bashir's great. If Derek Jeter married Mariah Carey, it wouldn't last, but I bet they'd have a kid like him."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, Flanders, your love quiz score is 61. That makes you a ""Frigid Frieda."" I took off thirty points for all that crying you did."

1,Marge Simpson,It's awfully small.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Aw, geez. I don't have anything to do anymore. With Banner around, alcohol and crime are history in this town. And so am I."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, sugar-booger!"
3,Bart Simpson,Uh-oh. We didn't reset the safety switch.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooo, I think he's a keeper."

5,Lisa Simpson,And why is Krusty on the couch?
5,Lisa Simpson,Professor.
0,Homer Simpson,"Look at that beautiful garbage! Other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it in this old abandoned mine."
0,Homer Simpson,Just warming it up. Now to melt the cheese in this croissant...and get rid of a little excess earwax...and smoke a relaxing cigar.
0,Homer Simpson,Oh no! Burns' Birthday!
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, fine."
1,Marge Simpson,"Sorry, Homie, but you promised to take me to the Apron Expo today."
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! The sky is blue. Donuts are plentiful. Friday is TGIF night on ABC. What's gotten into you?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hey, Pharaoh, those half-pint slaves are exodusing as we speak."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Um, according to the Mexican Council of Food, this expired two years ago."

7,Chief Wiggum,How'd you like it if I made fun of your pants?
5,Lisa Simpson,Lieutenant Smash...

3,Bart Simpson,"Man, this is livin'."
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, how many hours a day do you watch TV?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Okay, I assume you all know why you're here."
8,Ned Flanders,Well... I don't have one from you!
3,Bart Simpson,Huh? A cell phone!
3,Bart Simpson,You're gay for Moleman!
1,Marge Simpson,We're putting a stop to this right now!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, dear. I hope I wasn't too rough on him."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced. Colonel Klink, why have you forsaken me?"
3,Bart Simpson,There was no burglar.
5,Lisa Simpson,"It's not my nature to complain, but so far today we've had three movies, two film strips, and an hour and a half of ""magazine time."" I just don't feel challenged."

3,Bart Simpson,Tah dah!
0,Homer Simpson,I'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I'm not supposed to look out the window when I'm alone.

0,Homer Simpson,Cart.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Children, your test scores are down because we've been having so many assemblies, you haven't had time to study. This assembly will remedy that."

0,Homer Simpson,Stop that! I'm down here!
3,Bart Simpson,I am waiting for a bus.

1,Marge Simpson,"You're not going, and that's final."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey! Thank you, thank you."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, I want in! What does your crew need? A safecracker? A wheel man?"

0,Homer Simpson,Are you gonna do that every time I open one of these?
3,Bart Simpson,"No, act like a lion!"

1,Marge Simpson,"Seven years. A lot of memories. Talking, chatting..."
3,Bart Simpson,Not if you knew what he's been doing.

7,Chief Wiggum,"And Eddie, you're promoted to Lou."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, to be honest, Chief, I haven't lived in New Orleans for 42 years. Although... according to an article I read in Parade Magazine, a criminal by the name of ""Big Daddy"" runs this town."

0,Homer Simpson,Still? Then you're not gonna like your other present.
1,Marge Simpson,That's ridiculous.
1,Marge Simpson,"Get ready, skanks -- here comes the truth train!"
9,Moe Szyslak,Here you go.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Too fluffy, too Siamese, too needy, too stuck-up, infected eye, clearly a skunk. Me-ow!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Yes, my mistress."

4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Now that my Mom and Dad are back together, I'm happy every day. I can't wait to wake up so tomorrow can start."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I want you to eliminate this reporter: Kent Brockman. He found the gully where I dump electricity every summer to jack up prices.
1,Marge Simpson,"Mmm, I suppose I could..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, can you help me out here?"
0,Homer Simpson,"My old dorm room. Come on, baby, let's matriculate."

0,Homer Simpson,EVERYBODY HATES THAT STUPID JERK!
0,Homer Simpson,"Sure, sure!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"You listen to me, son. You've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life. Now what do you say?"
5,Lisa Simpson,You have to cut these six-pack holders up. Otherwise fish get trapped in them.
3,Bart Simpson,Yessir!
9,Moe Szyslak,Walk away from you.
11,Seymour Skinner,This isn't what I wanted! Where's the edge?
5,Lisa Simpson,"I can't believe the ""Gathering Shadow"" was Senate redistricting!"

10,Krusty the Clown,All good. I just have one non-negotiable demand:
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hello, Mr. Bighorn Sheep!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers! Come here, I want you."
3,Bart Simpson,Anything could happen. One of these days I might have a complete psychotic breakdown.
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, you're new to our school, so here's the deal: we call Skinner, ""Skin-rash,"" Mr. Wiener is ""Mr. Whiner,"" and Groundskeeper Willie, ""Grounds-creeper Stupid."""
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well done, Simpson. Now, walk behind me down the hallway."
5,Lisa Simpson,Did you know back in high school that she'd be such a star?
1,Marge Simpson,"What?!! Oh, my God!"
11,Seymour Skinner,Attention. All honor students will be rewarded with a trip to an archeological dig!

3,Bart Simpson,Lisa! You're saying we shouldn't tell the truth?
3,Bart Simpson,"After the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a Krusty Burger and head for the arcade."
1,Marge Simpson,His name is Bart.
6,Grampa Simpson,"...and he was giving away stuffed ""Isotoads"" to all the children."
5,Lisa Simpson,"And money is college, which should lead to more money some day, but who knows anymore?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"The rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide, dragging behind it the end of a vacuum cleaner cord."

3,Bart Simpson,And there's no hard feelings?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,New arena...

3,Bart Simpson,"Listen, um... after our fight, I couldn't sleep."
5,Lisa Simpson,Leaving!
1,Marge Simpson,Two more bites.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Mr. Simpson, I dread the day when a hundred thousand dollars isn't worth groveling for."
1,Marge Simpson,"I saved these for you, Bart. You'll always have them to remind you of the time when you were the whole world's special little guy."
0,Homer Simpson,At least she's found someone who can make her happy.
1,Marge Simpson,"Goodbye, my special, my special little guy. You will write us, won't you?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"What a great show. I wish it was today. So, what do you say, Bob?"

0,Homer Simpson,I think you'll find escape is quite impossible.
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm only one man, Marge."
0,Homer Simpson,And you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. So I'm gettin' you shined up nice.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Good Lord, Mother! I can see your... figure!"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Here you go, a Laffy Meal for you, and a Nostalgia Meal for me."
7,Chief Wiggum,"I'm afraid it doesn't look good, Kent. We found her sleeping bag."

4,Milhouse Van Houten,They say Dark Stanley makes your skull into a toilet and wee-wees into it...
0,Homer Simpson,"Apu, I have to lose weight now. Do you have anything that'll make me vomit?"
0,Homer Simpson,Turn that down! You call that music? I-- I just don't know what to do.
11,Seymour Skinner,And now the results. First Grade Rep: results delayed indefinitely due to jelly on the ballots. Second Grade Rep: Isabel GutiÃ©rrez.

5,Lisa Simpson,"Look at these obscure card games! Hey, do you have ""Uno?"""
11,Seymour Skinner,"I'm not sure what he's planning, although there is a lot of internet chatter. I want to change his character: less Dennis the Menace, more Casper the Ghost, if he were still alive."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Look, if I could just spend a few days in my room without anyone trying to cheer me up, I think I might have a chance to..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, sweetie. Hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?"

0,Homer Simpson,He's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!
1,Marge Simpson,But you'll get killed!
11,Seymour Skinner,"The order flourished, never forgetting its sacred mission. But word about the gem got out...and a group of high-ranking Freemasons, led by Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and King George the Third, staged a phony war of ""independence"" to cover their search for the gem."

0,Homer Simpson,The hospital?
1,Marge Simpson,"Hustle your bustles, gang! We're going to the Senior Olympics to root for Grampa!"

0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, I'm heading out now! More butt support! More butt support!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, smart guy. Where's the fire?"

4,Milhouse Van Houten,"When my Mom wants to get back at my Dad, she uses her lawyer."
0,Homer Simpson,"No! My wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. I took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"It is a good station, Bart, what with the ""Morning Cattle Drive"" and Armadillo Mike in the afternoon. And nothing keeps me informed like ""Rodeo Rick's News Roundup"" every hour on the--"

1,Marge Simpson,A wife needs to tell her husband she was wrong!
1,Marge Simpson,You're sure she'll have fun here?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, you know how unpredictable the French are. One minute they're kissing a woman's hand, the next they're chopping off her head. What if they start a war?"
3,Bart Simpson,"We can still order a replacement from the academy, right?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"The world has turned has it not my tin-plated friend? Look at you -- you, who were once so proud -- Feel the wrath of the left hand of Burns!"

5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you've gotta do something."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, ah, hey, ain't you gonna have a beer?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, this isn't the kind of thing I normally would think was a good idea, but you wouldn't have to live with Mr. Burns, you'd just get all of his money someday. This could provide for your entire future."

2,C. Montgomery Burns,I don't recall.

0,Homer Simpson,I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God. Plays.
1,Marge Simpson,I hope we're not spoiling them.

5,Lisa Simpson,Uh-oh. I don't like the sound of that.
0,Homer Simpson,"My marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. I failed. Quitting my dream job was the hardest thing I've ever done."

1,Marge Simpson,I feel kind of... melancholy...
3,Bart Simpson,"He'll be so happy, he'll be crying in his beard."
0,Homer Simpson,"I never thought I'd say this, but I wish Mr. Burns was back."
1,Marge Simpson,Are you sure you've thought this through? A child can really change your life.

3,Bart Simpson,"Three jumbo cherry Squishees and one double jumbo original flavor, sir."

3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, forget the donuts! We're here to go-nuts! Musically, that is!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, at least I'm on a path."

0,Homer Simpson,One thing I'm good at and I can't do it anymore.
7,Chief Wiggum,That's exactly how Dillinger got started.
5,Lisa Simpson,"I love it. I know I use the word ""empowering"" a lot, but this time it really is that."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, you seem like a nice enough guy, but I really don't have the time."
10,Krusty the Clown,"""Give the audience snowballs,"" they said. ""It'll be cute,"" they said."
1,Marge Simpson,You wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself!

10,Krusty the Clown,Where is that lousy little pisher?... Bart.
5,Lisa Simpson,Who's Mark Spitz?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, not literally. But in a way, isn't he everyone's son? For you see, that little ""hell-raiser"" is the spawn of every shrieking commercial, every brain-rotting soda pop, every teacher who cares less about young minds than about cashing their big, fat paychecks. No, Bart's not to blame. You can't create a monster and then whine when he stomps on a few buildings. I'm Lisa Simpson."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, this is it! TEOTWAWKI!"
3,Bart Simpson,"I wouldn't be here if you were more of a role model! Pub crawls, naked Frisbee golf..."

0,Homer Simpson,Mothers are so awesome.
9,Moe Szyslak,Hey! Get your mouth off a that!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Good luck, Ralphie! If your nose starts bleeding, it means you're picking it too much. Or not enough."

0,Homer Simpson,Get to the show!
9,Moe Szyslak,Precisely. Then I get in a skydiving accident and have to be rushed to the... graveyard?! They're killing off Dr. Tad Winslow!
1,Marge Simpson,"See? Isn't it nicer, with just you and..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get."

3,Bart Simpson,Got any threes?
3,Bart Simpson,I can't wait till I get good.

1,Marge Simpson,We need to have a conversation in loud whispers.
5,Lisa Simpson,Oh! You're gonna be late.
5,Lisa Simpson,"'Bye, Bart."

0,Homer Simpson,So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go! I'll be just fine!
0,Homer Simpson,Ho ho ho! A very small time!
1,Marge Simpson,"Nope. I'm sorry, Admiral, but you're still a stranger to me."
1,Marge Simpson,Boring!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh great, we've got to wait for Denis Leary! Hey Leary, if you want to have a tea party, go back to Boston!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hey Mick, will you teach us your cocksure strut?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! What kind of a world is this?"
6,Grampa Simpson,"No, no. Sixty-three times if you're out of air. Sixty-four is if you found the treasure."
6,Grampa Simpson,We're here -- and it's a good thing too. The car's been drivin' funny since Orlando.
7,Chief Wiggum,"You can have these, ah, fireworks I confiscated. Some Chinese people claimed they were celebrating New Year's in February."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad. Can you move your head?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?"

8,Ned Flanders,"Yeah, I, I guess I do."
1,Marge Simpson,"Grampa, that happened a year and a half ago! We have to go save Homer."

0,Homer Simpson,Private plane crashes.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,You don't have the guts.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Uhh, you bet I am!"

5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, get your own song."
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm just whistlin', man."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Put Winston in the front.
3,Bart Simpson,Elizabeth Taylor... Bette Midler...
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Marge. Some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ah, son. One day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday. Receiving a big fat check for a job well done."
1,Marge Simpson,Hm. Where in the hell is that soothing music coming from?
7,Chief Wiggum,"I'm sorry, kid. We got Simpson D.N.A. on Burn's clothing and your father was identified by the old man himself."
0,Homer Simpson,Start with Flanders... start with Flanders...
0,Homer Simpson,Who spread garbage all over Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?
0,Homer Simpson,Time for a shortcut.
3,Bart Simpson,All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas.
0,Homer Simpson,"That's right, except for the pick-up truck."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. Look at the line!"
9,Moe Szyslak,It does. We had thirty thousand here last night. Now play. The audience is gettin' restless.

0,Homer Simpson,I hate folding sheets.
0,Homer Simpson,Air?
5,Lisa Simpson,Is that Duncan?

1,Marge Simpson,"You know, Homie, a lot of men use their Saturdays to do things around the house, hint, hint."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Finished your soda, eh?"
0,Homer Simpson,"It's okay, Marge. We don't need to go on a trip. We'll just wait for the killer bees to come to us."
3,Bart Simpson,This place looks familiar.
3,Bart Simpson,Grampa.
0,Homer Simpson,"Mel, you're coming off desperate. Roll it, Louie!"
3,Bart Simpson,No! You can't take him now! We've only been on two rides!
8,Ned Flanders,Why don't you put this box by your phone so you don't call the number by accident.
0,Homer Simpson,Aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty Kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?
11,Seymour Skinner,I was wondering what she was doing here.
3,Bart Simpson,Apologize! For what?! Clearing the table? Having a sense of humor? They think they can starve an apology out of me. Ha!
8,Ned Flanders,"Matthew, Mark, Luke-and-John!"
1,Marge Simpson,"All those eyes, just leering and leering at us."
1,Marge Simpson,"Moe, do these guys think you're one of them?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"So, Bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of Kamp Krusty?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, Simpson, let's go over the signals."
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, that is true. In fact--"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I can't find anything on Sacagawea. Just a couple books on Ron Santo."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. Fighting him is like kicking George Washington in his wooden nuts!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, she'd never go. She's a vegetarian."
0,Homer Simpson,Pass the ketchup.
1,Marge Simpson,"I don't see any anger. I see a yearning for freedom... Um, do you have a title?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm still not sure about this."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hey, this is the best thing that ever happened to that loser. Women love famous felons."
5,Lisa Simpson,Let's go where it's quiet.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, you're barely eating."
1,Marge Simpson,"Good hustle, kid."
0,Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. There's already an on-set romance.
0,Homer Simpson,"So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow."
3,Bart Simpson,I almost died... and so did Willie.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,They get their moo-moo from a big-boy cup!
0,Homer Simpson,"Look boy, nobody knows better than me that you're a lost cause. But the school's paying for five sessions and there's a Chinese restaurant next door where I can get drunk."
3,Bart Simpson,"If you love me so much, why don't you marry me? That's a good one."
0,Homer Simpson,So remember...
5,Lisa Simpson,Jews don't believe in Hell.
0,Homer Simpson,'Bout time!

3,Bart Simpson,He's damn opposed! Damn! Damn! Damn opposed!
0,Homer Simpson,"Honey, did you get any sleep?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Boxing, Lisa, boxing. There's a world of difference."
5,Lisa Simpson,...Dad's idea pad...
10,Krusty the Clown,"Because I was thinking about the American family! One family in particular, who was stepped on by the government and had nowhere else to turn."
0,Homer Simpson,Where are you taking me?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Good one, ding dong!"
11,Seymour Skinner,Samantha I've always been suspicious of transfer students... Other principals try to unload problem cases that way... Lord knows I do.
0,Homer Simpson,Huh? A check?
0,Homer Simpson,Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Hello?
1,Marge Simpson,"What is it, Moe?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Ow! Indian burn!
1,Marge Simpson,"""Dear Homer Simpson -- Mr. Burns invites you to a hunting party at his private estate."" Parenthesis, sinister laugh, closed parenthesis."
5,Lisa Simpson,Get down. Security guard.
0,Homer Simpson,You mean there's a better way?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Smithers. The environmental effects won't be visible for years."
11,Seymour Skinner,Dear Lord! What are you doing?
5,Lisa Simpson,I wanna go lecture the food court businesses that are still using Styrofoam!
0,Homer Simpson,"All for you, baby."
1,Marge Simpson,"Y'know Bart, I don't think this is such a bad present. Maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does."
5,Lisa Simpson,We've left Earth's atmosphere!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Well, I'm not gonna let anything happen to my two best customers. I'm joining too."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, what will trick your parents into getting back together?"

5,Lisa Simpson,I learned that beneath my goody two-shoes lie some very dark socks.
1,Marge Simpson,"He's also thankful for your bounty, Lord."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I would like to say grace. Lord, have mercy on my soul, and Mom's soul, and Dad's soul, and Maggie's soul, and let every soul in Christendom..."

9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey Marge, uh, you care for a tropical drink?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Ah, my gym shorts."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ideally no, but..."
5,Lisa Simpson,Fully. We have to go now.
0,Homer Simpson,"You've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. After that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you can't get it together to leave. I'll get us some ice cream."
3,Bart Simpson,"So, you with me?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh my God, how long was I zoned out?"
0,Homer Simpson,"It's not an operation, Moe. The doctor says it's just a procedure."
3,Bart Simpson,You suck!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Krusty, your dad's a rabbi -- how could you not have had a Bar Mitzvah?"
5,Lisa Simpson,President Kennedy!
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, the contest isn't for three hours."

3,Bart Simpson,"Later, Homer."
5,Lisa Simpson,Goodbye.
0,Homer Simpson,Leeches!
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh-uh-uh... sorry Maggie, that's something to collect, not enjoy. It's one of my Humble figurines."

8,Ned Flanders,First things first!
0,Homer Simpson,It's better to be safe than sorry. Sorry.
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, you do. You're gay for Moleman!"
3,Bart Simpson,It wasn't me.
9,Moe Szyslak,"If Kemi there is a Nigerian princess, her brother just might be the Nigerian prince that took my money!"
3,Bart Simpson,Oh yes we do! I got it all on tape.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,A pool table? Are you mad? I'm not gonna turn his home into a saloon.
0,Homer Simpson,That is the darnedest thing!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Finally, in nineteen ninety-two, I was reunited with that chair. It wasn't quite the same."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge... in a gang? What're you gonna do, shoot me with a frosting gun? Seriously, I would love that."
11,Seymour Skinner,"It's the second most precious jewel in this bell tower. Patty, the question before you is will you marry me?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Wait a minute, Martin. If you, Milhouse and I went in together, we could buy a copy of ""Radioactive Man No. 1"" right now!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Yeah, I bet the old people will be acting like young people, like in those cell phone ads everyone hates."
8,Ned Flanders,Lock onto his wiener.

3,Bart Simpson,"Any new tattoos, Otto?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Kids, there's something I have to tell you -- your mother and I are wetting the bed."
1,Marge Simpson,"While you were out ""earning"" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. The plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in Monday."
3,Bart Simpson,"You're missing the best part, Sister. Forget that stupid book."
1,Marge Simpson,How ingenious. The forks are made out of Lego.
0,Homer Simpson,"You did it! Lisa thinks I'm the greatest. I might even put you to work on Bart and Maggie, go superdad on all their asses."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm back!"
1,Marge Simpson,What's with the lined composition book?
1,Marge Simpson,I didn't mean to.

5,Lisa Simpson,And there are so many places to cloister myself!

5,Lisa Simpson,Look at all these alternative comic book creators...
5,Lisa Simpson,I see your point.

3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, yes, ma'am!"
8,Ned Flanders,"You know, I pride myself on being a good host, so I'm obliged to offer you a beer. But I'm so darn mad it's gonna be mostly head."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, don't make things worse."
1,Marge Simpson,"Fat Tony, how can you do this?"
0,Homer Simpson,What has he done for me lately?
0,Homer Simpson,"It is me, Jesus!"
0,Homer Simpson,Beware of Marshall Goldmannn!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's the deal?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, that's a mirror."
3,Bart Simpson,"This sucks! I can't do anything fun, 'cause I'm doing so many stupid errands!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right. All right, I'll sweeten the deal. You can see the game, you don't have to come back, but you have to promise not to commit any more crimes, okay?"
1,Marge Simpson,Your majesty... did you remember to invite Ned Flanders?
3,Bart Simpson,"So please do not worry, 'cause we did okay."
1,Marge Simpson,Mm! Who knew that Lee Marvin could do such marvelous splits?
1,Marge Simpson,"All right! I admit it -- they're both at the Catholic Church! Reverend, what should I do?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"It is a tragedy for all us kids. But, Bart, you can't beat yourself up."
3,Bart Simpson,"Very good. Lisa, you always were the one rose petal floating atop the cesspool that is the Simpsons."
1,Marge Simpson,I'll twist this bottle in your face!
3,Bart Simpson,"Whoa! Ouch! Ow! Ooh! Oh no, boys, not the can, please."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sweetie, I've been thinking. Now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself. The problem's not that you were cheating...it's that you got caught."
5,Lisa Simpson,Not mine.
0,Homer Simpson,"Omigod! I don't believe it. It's really you, the Capital City ""Goofball."""
0,Homer Simpson,"No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I'm dying to know."
8,Ned Flanders,Now I know everybody's eager to get back to class --
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh yes you are. Why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Wow, Mom."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Don't listen to him, children."
3,Bart Simpson,"Actually, the idea to do this came from a book."
3,Bart Simpson,I fell on my bottom.
1,Marge Simpson,Stop! You're tainting my entry!
3,Bart Simpson,"Did your Secret Service goons ever whack anybody, George?"
1,Marge Simpson,Looks like you had a problem with those scrambled eggs.
11,Seymour Skinner,"It uh, broke on my buttocks."
0,Homer Simpson,"That's right. You're mine till you're eighteen. And when you're seventeen I'm gonna know the end is near, so I'm gonna work you like a dog."
0,Homer Simpson,And did you know that little Baby Jesus grew up to be... Jesus?
1,Marge Simpson,"They say if you kiss the Blarney Stone, you get ""the gift of gab."" Which is great, but I'm not sure I like the idea of getting a gift in return for kissing. What kind of a message is that for Lisa and Maggie? Those are my daughters. But on the other hand, America doesn't have any stones worth kissing -- except for Stone Phillips. Do you have one of him here? If so, he's our your him."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.
0,Homer Simpson,Mmm! That's the next best thing to eating Lenny.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, I do owe you everything... make it quick."
3,Bart Simpson,"Ice cream at church? I'm intrigued, yet suspicious."
3,Bart Simpson,CALF'S IN THE FIELD SO YOU SNEAK UP SLOW / GRAB 'IM BY THE TAIL AND GO MAN GO...
10,Krusty the Clown,I'm sick and tired of this woman...not being married to me!
3,Bart Simpson,"An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off, but three times as many plus six get on."
5,Lisa Simpson,Gift shop!
9,Moe Szyslak,"You know, they say that the love of a good woman can save any man."
0,Homer Simpson,"Really? Well, the time just flew by, didn't it?"
0,Homer Simpson,I want you to be Marge.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hello, Mom? You won't believe what Bart's doing."
3,Bart Simpson,Duh. Trashin' the hotel room.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, some people in Europe have the impression that America has made some stupid choices in the past, oh, five years. So for the next week, I'm from Canada."
5,Lisa Simpson,Uh... Mom?
8,Ned Flanders,The house is slightly askew! To the panic room!
6,Grampa Simpson,Hey! That got 'er goin'!
1,Marge Simpson,Fine. Since the color of my eyes isn't important to you then you don't get to see them until you remember!
0,Homer Simpson,I have a beauty of a sort to some.
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe thinks he knows a lot more than Moe knows! Well, just give me another chance, and I'll prove I can keep your secrets."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sure! Why, what did ya have in mind?"
1,Marge Simpson,I didn't say that.
3,Bart Simpson,Huh? Why not?
3,Bart Simpson,There must be some reason no one ever adopted you. Is one of your feet a hand?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I'll handle this. So, you're the head inspector?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"No one's ever won Moe's ""Drink A Gallon Of Gin Challenge."" And no one ever will."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"School's out! Up yours, Krabappel!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hi, Ralph. You were great tonight."

5,Lisa Simpson,Begone!
0,Homer Simpson,Looking for these? Dee-dee-dee.
0,Homer Simpson,We can hike anytime. This is our chance to see cars driving.
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't worry, sweetie, this is just the first of way too many awards shows. You'll get your chance to say ridiculous things."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, that's what I bought it for!"
3,Bart Simpson,Why am I just learning this now?
1,Marge Simpson,I really do miss my Homie this time of night.
1,Marge Simpson,"A drug? I know Bart can be rambunctious, but he's not some hyperactive monster."
0,Homer Simpson,I'M GONNA HAVE FORTY KEY CHAINS! / AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE FORTY KEYS! / SWAG!
3,Bart Simpson,You think so?
0,Homer Simpson,Kansas City.
3,Bart Simpson,Can I go with you to get the treasure? I won't eat much and I don't know the difference between right and wrong.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yum. I've got a dried out end-piece with your name on it, Lisa."
0,Homer Simpson,Fry up some cheese?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, please, I never ask for much, but this is something I really need."
0,Homer Simpson,"It's just you and me now, lock of hair..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, that's not true! Everyone in this family is your friend."
3,Bart Simpson,"There, there. You're safe now, little sister."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ah... great toast, Marge. Hmmm. Oh, by the way, the night before the election Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it?"
0,Homer Simpson,Six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend I actually got home at three a.m.
3,Bart Simpson,"What up, man? This is my manager slash sister, Lisa."
3,Bart Simpson,"We were going to keep the gray one, but the mother ate her."
0,Homer Simpson,"Thank you, Erin Choco-snitch. That was a group effort."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Snipers, take the shot!"
0,Homer Simpson,Great! Ya wanna get some lunch?
6,Grampa Simpson,Just give me the list. I can read.
0,Homer Simpson,Oh no! Urg... Arrrgh. C'mon you stupid tube!!!
3,Bart Simpson,... move your joystick to the left.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, your daughter is pouring her heart out!"
3,Bart Simpson,I think it sucks.
0,Homer Simpson,Lower! Lower!
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, talk about irony. The AMA tries to drive you guys out of business. Now you're doing the same to me. Think about the irony..."
3,Bart Simpson,Half-brother and half-sister?
5,Lisa Simpson,Dad!! Your hand is jammed in the toaster!!
0,Homer Simpson,Wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.
5,Lisa Simpson,Nick and I met talking through a crack between two booths!

3,Bart Simpson,"I don't think so, sir."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh. See, here's the problem, Ralph. You have several threes."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Springfield Gorge? Bart, you'll be killed!"
5,Lisa Simpson,It's the kind John Glenn eats when he's not in space.
11,Seymour Skinner,If this were a movie mother wouldn't let me watch it.
0,Homer Simpson,You love sausage but you hate to see it getting made.

2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, it's almost game time. Where the devil are my ringers?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"What's the matter, scared you might like it?"
0,Homer Simpson,It's not working.
5,Lisa Simpson,It's amazing how I can feel sorry for you and hate you at the same time. I'm sure there's a German word for it.
0,Homer Simpson,"Son, we're in this mess together. No matter how tempting it might be, I can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob."
0,Homer Simpson,I... I don't know!
0,Homer Simpson,Ha! I gotcha!
1,Marge Simpson,"A ""castle""... I know where they are!"
9,Moe Szyslak,You guys mind if I uh... kiss your tummies?
0,Homer Simpson,That's it. Nobody messes with my little girl. I'm gonna find those dolls.
9,Moe Szyslak,"No, no, no, no, no. No pansies for me."
0,Homer Simpson,Ow! Ow! Oh!
5,Lisa Simpson,"He said he went home, and his passport is gone. What country is he from?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, honey, you sold a house and got rid of the Flanders. What's for dinner?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I've learned something about the people of Iceland. You've endured barbarian invasions, total financial collapse, and a lesbian prime minister."
3,Bart Simpson,I just thank God you didn't take my coupons. Got enough for a month.
0,Homer Simpson,DANCIN' AWAY MY HUNGER PANGS / MOVIN' MY FEET SO MY STOMACH WON'T HURT / I'M KINDA LIKE JESUS / BUT NOT IN A SACRILEGIOUS WAY...

6,Grampa Simpson,"Hey, this ain't so bad."
1,Marge Simpson,You guys are the world's worst cops.
7,Chief Wiggum,We'll start the tour in a second. I just gotta check the answering machine.
11,Seymour Skinner,You mean your dad the raging alcoholic?
5,Lisa Simpson,This biography of Bart came out awfully quickly. It's not even about him.
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I'll be damned."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, when did you become a member of P.E.T.A.?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Finally, on a personal note, Mrs. Krabappel and I are to be joined in holy wedlock...this Saturday. We'll be honeymooning at Lake Shelbyville Lodge, Cabin Thirty-two, Room Three. And we do not wish to be disturbed."
0,Homer Simpson,I've already taken care of that.
0,Homer Simpson,But you do like comic books.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Um, Dad... ten percent of 120 million dollars isn't twelve thousand. It's..."
0,Homer Simpson,You've transformed breakfast into dinner. It's a miracle!
1,Marge Simpson,"Odd, that's what the valet just asked me."
5,Lisa Simpson,But I-I might infect the other kids!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Mr. Teeny, stop fiddling with the buttons! Oh, now you've gotten chocolate all over everything."
1,Marge Simpson,Of course I saved them.
6,Grampa Simpson,Great! Put it on number twenty.
0,Homer Simpson,"No, but I'm sure the good Lord will provide."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Willie, you're fired with complete loss of pension."
0,Homer Simpson,Savages.
5,Lisa Simpson,"That's sexist, but thank you."
0,Homer Simpson,That's another twenty or thirty years.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing."
5,Lisa Simpson,Hi there.
11,Seymour Skinner,They called me old-fashioned for teaching the duck and cover. But who's laughing now?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Thanks, Cap. Now what I'm proposing is a superhero pub crawl. Our clientele dress up in costume and go drinking from bar to bar. Their masks make 'em feel uninhibited, and invulnerable."
0,Homer Simpson,Homer is what grown ups call me. Call me Daddy.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, hey, kids! This putz only paid for twenty seconds, so listen fast. Moishe caught the chicken pox, he scratched all night and day / He asked the rabbi what to do, and he said Time! I'm outta here!"
0,Homer Simpson,Yahhhhhhhh!
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, uh... we're just rehearsing for ""Angry Dad: The Motion Picture""."
0,Homer Simpson,Don't look at me. Don't look at me!
1,Marge Simpson,"Uhh... you keep 'em. Now listen. If we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage Lisa. Umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the Museum on Saturday..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oooh, give it here."
1,Marge Simpson,"So, surfing is really your job?"
0,Homer Simpson,Ka-BLAMMO.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, you'll never learn."
0,Homer Simpson,She can smash a salad.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Just because it's too hip for you, Smithers..."
0,Homer Simpson,This address must be wrong.
5,Lisa Simpson,"But immigration is what America's all about. Even the Simpson family immigrated to America. Right, Grampa?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Our blueteeth!
0,Homer Simpson,You can still lick it!
0,Homer Simpson,Screw him.
9,Moe Szyslak,"And how are the little kids doin'? I mean really how are they doin'. Any disabling injuries? Something, say, that the gambling community might not yet know about? Come here, let me see those knees."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"There, there. Smithers, this monkey's going to need most of your skin."
1,Marge Simpson,It certainly has enriched our lives.
0,Homer Simpson,"A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?"
0,Homer Simpson,Hmmm. I will run for Mayor!
3,Bart Simpson,All right. It says here we can learn watch repair in eight one-hour lessons.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Looks like this is one time the Indians didn't win.
0,Homer Simpson,How can you write such horrible things about me?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Proceed, Smithers."
5,Lisa Simpson,"You could do what ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" did."
3,Bart Simpson,"What a day, eh Milhouse? The sun is out, birds are singing, bees are trying to have sex with them - as is my understanding..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hmm, what if I read every other word? ""One more time, you're hopeless. Try again, numb skull."" That's not very nice -- I will try again, but not because the wall told me to. ""Turn around. Seek Springfield's biggest man-made ring."""
0,Homer Simpson,"You there, boy! Buy me a Christmas goose! The biggest one in the shop!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, all right, all right, I'll get your milk!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Poindexter. It's Halloween, put the book away."
5,Lisa Simpson,It encapsulates America and makes history come alive!
0,Homer Simpson,"Huh, big deal. I've been carried out of Moe's like that hundreds of times."
0,Homer Simpson,"Which you must never use because it will ruin your life, lets Daddy see and hear magical things you will never experience. Ever."
10,Krusty the Clown,What?! I'll show you who's a cautionary tale!
1,Marge Simpson,Lisa's on the sleepy train / To rest her weary head / Her ticket is a candy cane / Made out of gingerbread.
3,Bart Simpson,Whoaa...
11,Seymour Skinner,Abandon gym!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, for the love of God."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Look, we got a package from the Mr. Sparkle Company in Japan!"
0,Homer Simpson,Good riddance. Their drawings suck and they look like hippies.
0,Homer Simpson,"Kids are so naÃ¯ve. Lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says ""Do Not Feed The Bears,"" man, you'd better not feed the bears."
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, you're never gonna get a husband by being sarcastic."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,A fake I.D.?! Cool!!
0,Homer Simpson,Some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey Homer, what do you think Mom meant by ""taking care of something?"""
0,Homer Simpson,"Go ahead and smile, smart guy. I'm gonna mop you up like turkey gravy."
0,Homer Simpson,Open.
0,Homer Simpson,Good thing it's laminated.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, can I get a duck?"
3,Bart Simpson,That's Milhouse.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, good. This makes up for me showing up drunk to the father-daughter dance."
0,Homer Simpson,Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps.
1,Marge Simpson,I think Bart and Lisa are feeling a little upset right now. Isn't there something you'd like to say?
0,Homer Simpson,What do I care?
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, if it'll make you feel any better, Krusty, you can punch me in the face."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip. If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,He's doing eighty years on an opium bust. I never saw a man take to a Turkish prison so quickly.
3,Bart Simpson,Now's our chance. Let's go!
3,Bart Simpson,Must... fight... Satan. Make it... up to him... later.
0,Homer Simpson,"He's talkin' like the guy in ""Fat Albert."" Howba areba youba?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, that's a filthy habit."
1,Marge Simpson,I've always believed in you even when others didn't. Can you help save our family Christmas? Marge Simpson.
1,Marge Simpson,"That's nice, dear!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Huh? Hurry up, Mom and Dad are probably worried sick."
1,Marge Simpson,Freeze!
5,Lisa Simpson,Huh. Two queens. That's a great start.
1,Marge Simpson,Me? A professional baker's employee? Imagine how different my life would be!
0,Homer Simpson,"Now they did say bed and breakfast, right?"
5,Lisa Simpson,It's jazz! Jazz! You don't even know the name of the thing you are stealing from me!
0,Homer Simpson,I hate them so much!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Please, don't do this, Dad! I don't know what horrors you saw in Boise, but it's not worth blowing up everyone you love."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, bottom bunk's mine."
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, I just got a little chill when you said my name."
1,Marge Simpson,"""Her turn-ons include thievery and liquor. Her turn-offs include underpants, pedestrians, and justice."""
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, I'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars to get them to shut up. From... anonymous."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ned Flanders, you would take our family to the Holy Land just to try to make my husband a better man?"
1,Marge Simpson,Ned... Rod needs to know you believe he can be okay on his own.
5,Lisa Simpson,I'll tell Professor Frink he's won. Tack fÃ¶r att ni fÃ¶rÃ¤rat vÃ¥r stad.
1,Marge Simpson,"You have to admit, ""Bart Simpson Will Die"" was kind of open to interpretation."
0,Homer Simpson,This is a classic nineteen seventy-eight Pizza Hut! Mmm... terrible.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Look, do you want this to be your last school memory?"
0,Homer Simpson,Lisa! You have a guest!
0,Homer Simpson,"Listen, old-timer, I'd like you to meet Mason Fairbanks."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ooh, another Grobanite!"
1,Marge Simpson,"No, Homer. The truth would humiliate her."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hi honey, how are you?"
0,Homer Simpson,Okay -- Maggie gets a toy!
1,Marge Simpson,Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Do you want me to?
1,Marge Simpson,I guess I was the last one.
0,Homer Simpson,Give me back my wife!
11,Seymour Skinner,"There's no hope for you, Simpson. You'll be locked in detention until you graduate to the penal system."
10,Krusty the Clown,So that's the plan: we're meeting at the reservoir at eight p.m.
3,Bart Simpson,"Before we vote, I'd just like to point out in Sophie's Choice she saved the boy."
5,Lisa Simpson,"HUSH, LITTLE BABY, DON'T SAY A WORD / MAMA'S GONNA BUY YOU A MOCKINGBIRD / AND IF THAT MOCKINGBIRD DON'T SING..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, thanks..."
0,Homer Simpson,Access denied.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Guess what happened to me last night!
0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I got skybox tickets! And with only twenty percent loss of my brain function. Life is...
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, don't you wanna take your shoes off before you go swimming? Professor? Oh. Oh. Um. Mm."
11,Seymour Skinner,Take your sash and go.
3,Bart Simpson,"All right, the mall!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Listen up, here. Tomorrow night at eight, you go down to the waterfront and you ""steal"" my car."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Burns!
0,Homer Simpson,I had this idea years ago...but your mother wouldn't let me do it.
0,Homer Simpson,"We put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to what matters: the show, and the Sunday comic strip."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Look at that, they've recreated the thirties... tent cities... failing banks..."
1,Marge Simpson,Homer?! Did you eat that donut?
0,Homer Simpson,"There is something wrong with that kid. She's so moral. Why can't she be more like... well, not like Bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium."
3,Bart Simpson,I've got to be honest with you. It was just a bag of rice I drew a face on.
1,Marge Simpson,"Empathy means you're looking at Lisa, and feeling what she feels. Your sister poured her heart into rescuing those animals to forget the pain of being upstaged in jazz. And now..."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
0,Homer Simpson,Our money's gone.
1,Marge Simpson,What about Maggie?
1,Marge Simpson,You'll be my friend. I'm never gonna let you get away.
0,Homer Simpson,"I won't say, but his initials are S.F."
5,Lisa Simpson,Such an intricate formicarium! I'm the proudest myrmecologist on the block.
3,Bart Simpson,"No, that's okay. You can stay. You can read comics with us. Let's see, something for the lady...ah, ""Radioactive Man Vs. the Swamp Hag."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Take a hike, Hollywood. I've already got a college boy to turn my every word into syndicated gold."
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, if anyone needs me I'll be taking a popcorn bath. It's a thing I read about in a Men's Health magazine in a dream."
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm sorry, Ned. I never thought this would happen."
3,Bart Simpson,Coooool.
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, it's ours?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, Lis! Check it out. Dad's on TV."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hey, no, no, what do you think you're--"
3,Bart Simpson,"No offense, Wendell."
0,Homer Simpson,...And I never saw Gallagher again.
1,Marge Simpson,But you wanted those toys.
10,Krusty the Clown,"People, we went through something magical together -- and it's not important who got rich off of whom, or who was exposed to tainted what. And because you believed in my dream, I want you to fight over the last Ribwich ever made. Here."
0,Homer Simpson,"And it's something to be feared -- right, Doctor?"
5,Lisa Simpson,What'd ya bring? What'd ya bring?
0,Homer Simpson,Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Children, help! He's killing me!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Because when you get down to it, aren't all religions the same? They tell you what to eat, when to pray... how this imperfect clay that we call man can mold itself to resemble the divine. But we can never attain that ultimate grace while there is hatred in our hearts for each other."
1,Marge Simpson,What do you think?
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I was trying to buy you snack cakes..."
9,Moe Szyslak,And that's the origin of that.
0,Homer Simpson,What's your secret?
3,Bart Simpson,"Get 'em, boys!"
0,Homer Simpson,Bring me two of every animal.
6,Grampa Simpson,Pipe down!
0,Homer Simpson,It's even boring to fly over it!
0,Homer Simpson,What's your hurry?

4,Milhouse Van Houten,When are they going to get to the fireworks factory?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh... you told me not to do it a year ago. Remember?"
1,Marge Simpson,"So, you're married and you're looking for your first house, Mr. and Mrs..."
1,Marge Simpson,We're almost finished. There's just a little bit of green left.
1,Marge Simpson,You let me believe that I'd done such a terrible thing?
5,Lisa Simpson,An absence of mood swings and some stability in my life.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Sorry Bart, I'm deeply immersed in the Teapot Dome Scandal."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Fleeing the violence, the nuns of Saint Teresa's left the colonies and settled here in Springfield."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ten dollars?! What is this, a car wash for millionaires?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooh, the baseball-playing man! I barely recognized you without your costume on."
1,Marge Simpson,Should I just back out of the room?
0,Homer Simpson,There's one on Lisa!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yes, it's the preferred term. And most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out. But some think they may be a gateway to other universes."
9,Moe Szyslak,Which means this joint is closed for the night.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Can't read my own writing. But I'll tell you this, warden, it starts with an ""H""..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, take a picture of me with all the milkshakes. C'mon, everybody get in here. Hurry."
0,Homer Simpson,A shrink who takes kids and pets?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Jet pack! Of course I'm Clancy Wiggins, you idiot."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry, I don't really want to be here."
1,Marge Simpson,"We've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- I mean, I know this is different than that time I washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but I--"
9,Moe Szyslak,Shagadelic.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I haven't decided what kind of new car to get."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas."
3,Bart Simpson,"LaBoot, LaBoot. Sounds familiar."
0,Homer Simpson,Monitors?!
1,Marge Simpson,We better call Ned. He has a ladder.
0,Homer Simpson,We had just finished our first smooch. And I felt a feeling I'd never felt before:
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ooh / Meow / Dad, stop you're embarrassing us / Stop please."
0,Homer Simpson,"I know, it's weird, isn't it?"
0,Homer Simpson,Really? Don't you ever look up at the sky?
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, Master."
3,Bart Simpson,"Really?! Wow, I should've started a long time ago!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Where have you been, Granny? Did they freeze you or something?"
3,Bart Simpson,Why are you dressed like Catwoman?
0,Homer Simpson,Whoa! Hang on a minute! The guard said I have visitors coming!
0,Homer Simpson,"Mine. Oh, move your hand. I get this!"
1,Marge Simpson,The can is in the cupboard on the bottom shelf.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homer. Your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it."
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, there's Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, Paul McCartney, Michael Jordan, Michelle Kwan..."
7,Chief Wiggum,Say... has he ever thought about a career in law enforcement?
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, you're forgetting the beer. It comes in seventy-two ounce tubs here."
3,Bart Simpson,Now that is good Labneh.
3,Bart Simpson,"Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, we've got cocktail wienies and Swedish meatballs."
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, cat. Now, if this works, your next trip will be to the bank vault."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I don't know, but she's my new hero."
5,Lisa Simpson,Ralph and I could do the report together.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. And the wrapper says ""Albuquerque Isotopes""!"
0,Homer Simpson,"In the net, right?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Fire can be our servant, whether it's toasting s'mores, or raining down on Charlie. But it can turn not-so-nice, as you'll see in this skit by the Volunteer Fire Department Players."
1,Marge Simpson,Tap out! Don't make me break your arm!
8,Ned Flanders,And so white-bread Ned became the avenging sword of the Lord.
0,Homer Simpson,Hi-Yo!
3,Bart Simpson,I'll do my best.
9,Moe Szyslak,"I'll give you two bucks for the bird, if it's still alive."
1,Marge Simpson,"Lookin' good, Rod!"
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! Watch your mouth!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Burns, I came here because my brother is about to be wrongfully convicted. And the man I'm looking for would help me find the truth."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting."
0,Homer Simpson,Okay... I'll take some of... that.
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm happy you got the potholes filled, but it's still irresponsible to present rumors as facts. Maybe you should quit while you're ahead."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"You said you weren't gonna tell! Oh wait, you didn't. So no one knows who the Milhouse is."
0,Homer Simpson,"Of course, you idiot, 'cause I'm wishing for more money."
5,Lisa Simpson,By discussing the school's budget crisis?
11,Seymour Skinner,You're stealing a table?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, drive defensively."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, they've found a home."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I'd be happy to wind up just like you.
10,Krusty the Clown,All you have to do is write me a letter about how hip and influential your parents are.
0,Homer Simpson,"Tick tock, sweetie."
0,Homer Simpson,"Doctor, I'm embarrassed to show my body to my wife. And it's all because of your surgery!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"You know, it's funny, Smithers. I tried every tincture and poultice and tonic and patent medicine there is. And all I really needed was the blood of a young boy. By the way, what was the lad's name?"
6,Grampa Simpson,I can't remember when I felt this young. I really can't.
3,Bart Simpson,"My theory is, Skinner likes dog food."
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm so glad we came to Paradise Pier. Ever since I was a little girl, I've wanted to ride that Ferris Wheel!"
0,Homer Simpson,Nooooooo...
0,Homer Simpson,Casino?
7,Chief Wiggum,"So, what do you know?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Maybe my Mom and Dad are meant to be together, Bart."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"In case you didn't hear me, I said I will never see you as my equal."
0,Homer Simpson,Going for... eight hour walk.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I... I think we should dress the snowmen.
0,Homer Simpson,You can't close! I'll have to go home and drink better beer at half the price in natural lighting!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, I didn't get drunk. I just went to a strange fantasy world. C'mon, you gotta believe me. You're my soul mate."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"You've changed, man. You used to be about the music."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, we could make a fortune with these Bible pictures. And I've been looking for a way to launder the money I made selling club soda as flu vaccine."
0,Homer Simpson,The boy's flash drive may be in there. But I've got a lifetime of nuclear secrets up here.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad."
5,Lisa Simpson,No! I don't agree!
9,Moe Szyslak,Nothin' to live for.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Great. What do I say?
1,Marge Simpson,"""She's The Fastest..."" Homer, I don't think that means necessarily..."
0,Homer Simpson,To the hottest girls in the room.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes -- Uh, then I'll form my own religion!"
7,Chief Wiggum,Not so fast! You're wanted for the murder of Seymour Skinner.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, I'd love to, if it's not an imposition."
0,Homer Simpson,Now that's not true! You're cute as a bug's ear.
1,Marge Simpson,Don't lie to me. Are you having an affair with this woman?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, that's my joke! Eh, must be a coincidence."
3,Bart Simpson,"Pinball, eh? I've always wanted to try this."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'd like a beer, please."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I won't go without a fight, wink, wink. Heh. Let me show you around."
0,Homer Simpson,Aw. Just like on TV.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Who would film such a thing?
0,Homer Simpson,Find a husband? Which one's Selma again?
0,Homer Simpson,Mr. Burns... Can you make me thin again?
1,Marge Simpson,I am so cheesed off. I need a drink!
11,Seymour Skinner,"But when you get to the trophy case, give her some cock 'n bull story. They're out for cleaning, or whatever."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm taking Lisa out of that stupid-- What the?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, like the guy who designed Bender just took a drawing of Dad and stuck an antenna on it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Come on, loosen up. This is paradise."
7,Chief Wiggum,Well well well. Selling T-shirts without a permit.
3,Bart Simpson,"Cool, the NFL's oldest surviving player."
1,Marge Simpson,But you did have violent diarrhea. Nobody open the hallway closet until I say it's okay.
0,Homer Simpson,That's the sneeze guard. You have to lean under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh sure, speed walking, ballroom dancing, rhythmic gymnastics, extreme choir..."
0,Homer Simpson,I think I'll be good tonight and stay in with you.
1,Marge Simpson,I stole it from McBain after I cut off your father's thumb.
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, Dad, I guess you won."
3,Bart Simpson,ROLLIN' ON MY SKATEBOARD / PIMPIN' LIKE A DRUG LORD...
1,Marge Simpson,Who's going to clean up all those jets?
3,Bart Simpson,"Krusty Visits Relatives in Annapolis, Maryland..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Eh, it's still better than Indian food."
3,Bart Simpson,The sit is on.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, but I know a story of a dangerous obsession with female beauty. It's called ""Snow White and the Seven..."""
5,Lisa Simpson,My Bongo drums!
3,Bart Simpson,This one spent two hours in the broiler.
0,Homer Simpson,The rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...
7,Chief Wiggum,"Okay, drop the knife, Stabatha. I-- Great Grucci's ghost! We've uncovered a hard-core cracker house."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh. Here's your slingshot, Lisa."
3,Bart Simpson,Okey-dokey.
0,Homer Simpson,How did you know?
0,Homer Simpson,I did it! I'm gonna be rich!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, don't just gasp, read it."
0,Homer Simpson,SUGAR. DO DO DO DO DO DO AWWW. HO--NEY. HO.....NEYYY. DO DO DO DO DO DO. / YOU ARE MY CANDY GIRRRRL Lousy piece of junk!
5,Lisa Simpson,You gave away my room!
1,Marge Simpson,"Sir, thank you for saving us. Do you want to come in for coffee?"
3,Bart Simpson,Yeah. I'm the 28th President of the United States.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too."
3,Bart Simpson,Problem solved.
0,Homer Simpson,Men's room? Oh my god! We're completing each other's...
3,Bart Simpson,Superman.
1,Marge Simpson,Hmph. It's raining again.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Splendid! Shall we discuss music, or the weather?"
0,Homer Simpson,That's it! I'll go on a hunger strike.
0,Homer Simpson,"Test, test..."
0,Homer Simpson,Are you sure you're here voluntarily?
3,Bart Simpson,"""I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable""... Walt Whitman, ""Leaves of Grass""."
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, a good man really is hard to find."
5,Lisa Simpson,"So, how was it in the slammer?"
0,Homer Simpson,Jogging?!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Not my concern!
0,Homer Simpson,"In about fifteen minutes I'd take off that wedding dress, or you're gonna look crazy."
0,Homer Simpson,There'll be plenty of time for that! I've got tons of important stuff to do.
0,Homer Simpson,Three Ribwiches please. And instead of a shake I'd like a blended Ribwich.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Bart, I'm impressed with what you did in there. You testified for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in a noose. On the other hand, you skipped school."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Sorry I'm late, everyone. I had some trouble getting the voicemails off the nine-one-one line. Why does everyone have to talk so fast and panicky?"
0,Homer Simpson,What country is this car from?
0,Homer Simpson,What about Mosquito Cove?
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and I got the day off from work."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Thanks, son. So you see old people aren't so useless after all. Molloy's old and he outsmarted the lot of ya. And I'm even older and I outsmarted him."
5,Lisa Simpson,Venus Simpson? You're replacing me?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,But... I made all the right moves! Didn't I?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, I've seen your Curly too."
0,Homer Simpson,And then today at lunch Lenny and I went to the park and rented a rowboat. Carl sketched us from the bank. Summer days.
5,Lisa Simpson,"... and we deserve a French teacher who actually speaks French. J'accuse, Monsieur Kupferberg!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Krusty, are you alright?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I know, it is stupid. I think it could work, though. I even got a title: ""Pontiff No Return"". I came up with it, but I don't really get it."
0,Homer Simpson,Stealing is wrong.
3,Bart Simpson,"Um, I don't want to alarm you, but the ice cream's startin' to go south."
1,Marge Simpson,He's ten years old!
3,Bart Simpson,We did that one already!
0,Homer Simpson,You did that on purpose! You lick this table clean!
0,Homer Simpson,"Let's see. One, two, three... six whiskeys!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Yes, I'm quitting show business. I was just tryin' to go out with a little class, you jackass."
3,Bart Simpson,One or two?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I enjoy all the popular youth trends. Like, uh, mm...piloting motorcoaches... and, uh..."
11,Seymour Skinner,I've got it! What are you doing? Give me that phone.
1,Marge Simpson,Moe? What are you doing?
1,Marge Simpson,"Oooh, this one looks very reputable."
0,Homer Simpson,It can't just be sex. It can't.
7,Chief Wiggum,That is pretty smart.
11,Seymour Skinner,"I'm a small man in some ways, Bart. A small, petty man. Three months detention."
3,Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Seymour."
3,Bart Simpson,"Whoa, Bart Simpson is nobody's sidekick."
0,Homer Simpson,I'll treasure this poncho forever.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,You're suspended without pay! Take your clacking balls and go.
1,Marge Simpson,Will you turn that engine off?
0,Homer Simpson,"They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. But if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. Bart!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, son."
1,Marge Simpson,"Maple syrup, mixed with baby spit-up and shoe scuff! This is going to take my whole arsenal at once!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Honey, I know you want to see Japan, but we're down to our last million yen."
0,Homer Simpson,The only tummy ache is in my head. I can't stop wondering who my real father might be.
3,Bart Simpson,Maybe she's one of those sexy school- supply company reps.
1,Marge Simpson,Just hope the kids didn't hear us.
1,Marge Simpson,Mr. Burns? You care about children?
1,Marge Simpson,No. I lost.
5,Lisa Simpson,Adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"If you see only one film this year that proves my innocence, make it this one."
0,Homer Simpson,"Not naked, I haven't."
1,Marge Simpson,You've been working so hard lately. Maybe you should take a break.
1,Marge Simpson,Go around! Go around!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Once again I'm the lower bound! You're it!
0,Homer Simpson,Bwa?
0,Homer Simpson,Where'd you get that dress?
6,Grampa Simpson,I'm up! I'm up!
0,Homer Simpson,"When you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote ""NO"" on Proposition 24!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, you did. But -- I still don't know... I can just imagine what Marge would say."
6,Grampa Simpson,"That's the activity room. We're not allowed in there. That's the library. Not allowed in there, either. And don't even think about going in the game room..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again."
0,Homer Simpson,That's for employing me for eight years! Ha ha.
3,Bart Simpson,Okay. You got my attention.
1,Marge Simpson,My daughter's a vegetarian.
9,Moe Szyslak,Bye bye!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I won't forget who mocked me! I'm taking your picture!
7,Chief Wiggum,"We got a complaint from an anonymous ""neighboreeno"" about an elaborately-choreographed high-octane ultra-fight."
1,Marge Simpson,His name isn't Bigfoot. His name is Homer.
1,Marge Simpson,"No, oh, Artie!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! Please, no rubes..."
0,Homer Simpson,I thought I was doing Donald Trump.
1,Marge Simpson,"No-o-o-o-o-o-o!!! All righty, time for bed."
0,Homer Simpson,He makes me sick.
0,Homer Simpson,How was that?
0,Homer Simpson,I've only got three more years to live!
1,Marge Simpson,"It may contain brief rudeness, adult explosions, and scenes with Garry Shandling."
1,Marge Simpson,"No, Homer. It's mine."
0,Homer Simpson,Only till eleven.
0,Homer Simpson,Damn right.
1,Marge Simpson,"They're not going to close the plant, are they?"
5,Lisa Simpson,You want an alien? This is your alien!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Dying?!
6,Grampa Simpson,"Bea told me to enjoy my moola and I'm going to, dagnabit!"
0,Homer Simpson,Bubble wrap!
0,Homer Simpson,Or that we made a few adjustments to the soda machine...
1,Marge Simpson,...so we can go inside Homer's sleeping mind and find out why he's wetting the bed.
1,Marge Simpson,People saw our story on the news and they've opened their hearts to us!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Lisa, you're old enough now that I can tell you the truth: there's no such thing as the sewer cops. It's just something we tell kids to make them feel safe."
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, sweetie, I'm tired of being a pushover."
1,Marge Simpson,"No, the March primary."
0,Homer Simpson,It's gone. And we still don't have any proof.
0,Homer Simpson,There are some dogs. We could all ride dogs.
3,Bart Simpson,A hundred pork chops!
11,Seymour Skinner,Nooooo!
3,Bart Simpson,"That's ridiculous. If you didn't write it, who in the world could have?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Without that bill, this ain't a museum. The Hard Rock CafÃ© in Phoenix has better crap."
6,Grampa Simpson,You two look good. Open-casket good!
1,Marge Simpson,I talked to Dr. Hibbert today. He gave me a list of heart-smart foods.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, back to normal."
5,Lisa Simpson,Go on! Swim to freedom! Go!
11,Seymour Skinner,"... the following alternative sports will be offered: dodge-rock, volley-brick, and base-game."
1,Marge Simpson,The poor boy is so desperate. He wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
7,Chief Wiggum,It's toys for guns.
0,Homer Simpson,I punched Mr. Burns right in his 104 year-old face.
1,Marge Simpson,"Everyone here in the United States is fine. We think Maggie may say her first word any day now. Lisa got an A in Math, which I'm only mentioning as news -- I'm not putting you down. And your father, well... last night he went to sleep talking about how much he loves you."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oopsie. Mm, this could take a minute."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh Homie, I'm so sorry."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hm. Well, maybe marriage isn't just for gays. What's that thing called when a guy is gay for a girl?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,What are they saying?
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry I called you a baboon, Dad."
7,Chief Wiggum,Even the fire doesn't want them.
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, you want hardwood?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll be there next Sunday. Front row, center!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Governor, I think the only fair solution is to pardon all these thugs and murderers."
6,Grampa Simpson,THIS IS THE LIFE IN IRE-LAND...

4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Gee, Bart. You seem, uh, how can I put it? Milhousey."
0,Homer Simpson,A plane crash!
8,Ned Flanders,"That concludes our Halloween show for this year. I just want to say that for watching this network, you're all going to Hell. And that includes FX, Fox Sports and our newest Devil's portal, The Wall Street Journal! Welcome to the club!"
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm sorry I cost you your fortune, Grampa."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Hm. Oh yes.
0,Homer Simpson,Bart cost us fifty thousand dollars.
5,Lisa Simpson,Wait. All that was in the recipe?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, islands are always entertaining, from Gilligan to Iwo Jima."
3,Bart Simpson,LET'S HIT THE FLOOR!
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, sweetie... I know I said you couldn't have a cell phone, but, in these days of stranger dangers and sinister ministers, I think it's important that we're in touch."
10,Krusty the Clown,"What a number! You kids got talent -- and I should know, I used to have it!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Sure, they could be here. Who knows?"
1,Marge Simpson,Don't you push them! They've gotta work that out for themselves.
1,Marge Simpson,Watering can!
1,Marge Simpson,For the last twenty years!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hurry, hurry up! I have to pee!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I can hear you.
6,Grampa Simpson,Over there / Send the word / Send the word / Over there.
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, Dad. Didn't you ever do anything wild when you were a kid?"
7,Chief Wiggum,We'll let a judge be the judge of that.
0,Homer Simpson,"I came to fight City Hall. I wanna shake things up, Patterson. Stir up some controversy. Rattle a few cages."
1,Marge Simpson,"Merry Christmas, Homie. I think you're really gonna like this."
3,Bart Simpson,I only eat the clown heads.
1,Marge Simpson,"When I asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you told me ""no."" You go downtown first thing in the morning and straighten this out."
1,Marge Simpson,So many unhappy men. How sad.
0,Homer Simpson,What is this place?
3,Bart Simpson,"TV sure has come a long way, huh Milhouse?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, cold shoulder, huh? Well, I'll just talk to myself. Hey, how ya doin', Homer? Oh, not too bad, how about you? Oh I'm fine. Your wife was great in bed last night. You keep your hands off my wife! Oh yeah? Well I give her what she needs. And she likes..."
0,Homer Simpson,We're here.
0,Homer Simpson,"It didn't blow over, Marge. Nothin' ever blows over for me."
3,Bart Simpson,"I guess this is the end, Wendell."
0,Homer Simpson,"Flanders has cooties, Flanders has cooties."
3,Bart Simpson,/ Hilarious!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, my poor Homie! This is what I was hoping for... for it not to have been completely his fault! Thank you, Moe."
1,Marge Simpson,I've never been so glad to be home.
1,Marge Simpson,Do you know what I'd settle for if it was up to me? Bart's medical bills and an apology!
0,Homer Simpson,Because we send them money?
1,Marge Simpson,"No, no, no, let's just keep playing. What's the score?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Did I forget to mention yoooouuu?
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it."
0,Homer Simpson,And I looked so good on that box.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Don't sweat it. The life of ""Rory B. Bellows"" is insured for a surprisingly large amount."
11,Seymour Skinner,Why this is retardant.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, all the childless drunks at Moe's thought it was a great idea."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, look what this is doing to Grampa. We have to settle this question once and for all with a paternity test."
5,Lisa Simpson,She means the most authentic.
5,Lisa Simpson,I'd rather not go than lie.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ooh, the Germans are mad at me. I'm so scared. Ooh, the Germans."
1,Marge Simpson,Right here in Dayton.
1,Marge Simpson,"This isn't over, Becky. I know where you live: My house!"
5,Lisa Simpson,No it isn't. It's totally inaccurate--
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, sure you did."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh-oh. You've gotta help me, Bart."
0,Homer Simpson,I need a mouth hole. And some other holes too.
0,Homer Simpson,"... And after Moe's, we went to Krustyburger and the mayor got some more change, and I ordered a double double, but they gave me the double double double double. And then Apu gave the Mayor lots of change for..."
3,Bart Simpson,A what? With who?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Uh, you look pretty clean. You, uh, mind if I had this dance?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Chloe left town as soon as Barney proposed. I would've followed her, but my plans changed when God brought me a wonderful little boy... Bart, stop that!"
3,Bart Simpson,"No, mom, you said poor house."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Well, we're still on. Three hundred and forty-six consecutive hours. And all because of one little boy who... who won't let me stop! Anyway... now let's go over and see if Sideshow Mel has any more of those legal, over-the-counter wake-up drugs of his."
3,Bart Simpson,Moms don't get lonely.
10,Krusty the Clown,"These Krusty brand balloons are three bucks each, but get a cheap one and what happens? It goes off, takes out the eyeballs of every kid in the room. What's that gonna cost yA? Hey Bill, what did that cost us?"
1,Marge Simpson,We did -- Homer took him. Didn't you?
5,Lisa Simpson,I've read that people do strange things in their sleep when they've taken Ambien -- I mean Nappien.
3,Bart Simpson,It's hard to pick just one of those.
0,Homer Simpson,"Thanks, Flanders. Punch my eye, destroy my marriage. Now just pull the plug and let me die."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Tom Landry's hat! And it's autographed! ""To Berman's Dry Cleaning, Best Wishes, Tom Landry."""
0,Homer Simpson,"I will, but you know me and my crazy number thing where I always have to get to seventeen. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop! Whoops, I lost count. Better start again. Voop! Voop! Voop! Voop!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart, it's the symbol of everything fine inside us."
0,Homer Simpson,Got any junk that will go up in value after you die?

8,Ned Flanders,"You have yourself a bet, you jackaninny!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Esme Delacroix! She wrote ""To Kiss a Scoundrel!"""

6,Grampa Simpson,"OH, GOD, NOOOO!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Help me, science!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, Bart. Yeah, you got your daddy's hustle."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's too bad."
3,Bart Simpson,...And then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other. Why is he always making up those crazy stories?
10,Krusty the Clown,What the hell are you laughing at? I'm just tellin' the truth!
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, get out of there!"
3,Bart Simpson,Wow! Can I see your club?
1,Marge Simpson,It's almost lunch time. Do you know where your brother is tutoring?
0,Homer Simpson,"Now all we need is our astronaut. Bart, where's America's newest hero?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Granted. But you gotta admit, constant supervision has been good for Bart. He might even make the honor roll, if Dad can control his night terrors."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah! Look, Smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. And what's your name?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, Marge. I think that if you told me I would remember! I mean I'm not an idiot!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ooh, family trees -- the charts representing genealogical relationships in a branching structure!"

0,Homer Simpson,Then forget it!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,No. It feels weird.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, no, no. It was just a TV show... Mitch Miller was yelling at one of his idiot singers. You just concentrate on catchin' the fish and not whether there'll be someone there to cook it."

1,Marge Simpson,And what's that hitchhiker doing here? Is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad please, for the last time, I beg you, don't lower yourself to the level of the mob."
9,Moe Szyslak,Does he have a computer?
0,Homer Simpson,"Ahh, the morning horoscope. ""Today will be a day like every other day."" It just gets worse and worse."

0,Homer Simpson,I don't feel much like eating. I'll never know what would've happened if I'd have been Class President.
5,Lisa Simpson,Um... I think it's... we don't have one.
6,Grampa Simpson,Terrible -- I got this new roommate and he won't stop yappin'!
6,Grampa Simpson,"You quit drinkin', like a coward! The one thing you were good at!"
0,Homer Simpson,Sh!
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute, Barney. You gotta be sober to fly. I mean, it's not like drivin' a car."
0,Homer Simpson,You guys are right -- I should get back in the game. But I threw away my camera.
0,Homer Simpson,No Moe. You've got it all wrong. People buy beer from you.
3,Bart Simpson,"Eh, free is free."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Well, I guess I can just keep watching DVDs by following family vans around."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, my God, what is that?..."
3,Bart Simpson,War Heads? Jelly Bellies? We're like two kids in a candy store!
6,Grampa Simpson,Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcano-coniosis?
0,Homer Simpson,"This may not be the top, but it's as close as a Simpson's ever gonna get."
11,Seymour Skinner,"No, no, it's quite sound."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Could you explain your model, young man?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, all right, but I'm taking some of the ironing with me in the car."
0,Homer Simpson,Uh... this is still part of your dream. Dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, don't you see? Our differences are only skin-deep..."
0,Homer Simpson,I was told this would be televised!
3,Bart Simpson,"Alec Baldwin, wow. That is the coolest person you've ever been fired by. What was it like at their house?"
3,Bart Simpson,There's only one thing to do at a moment like this... strut.
0,Homer Simpson,"I said, it's... Ohhh..."
1,Marge Simpson,Thanks for the meatloaf recipe. I claim it as my own.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, reckless youth."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I could have smoked that pot. And worn that hair."
3,Bart Simpson,"No, I mean teacher."
0,Homer Simpson,HOPIN'! HOPIN'!
3,Bart Simpson,"It's okay, Dad. He's just putting the fear of God in me."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,The Sunday funnies?
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, get a hold of yourself. This is LAMB... not A lamb."
0,Homer Simpson,Something I should have done a long time ago...
1,Marge Simpson,"Yeah, I was a little surprised I wasn't considered before. Todo o meu marido se preocupa Ã© ser um herÃ³i para sua filha. Por favor, perdoa-lhe."
1,Marge Simpson,"Thanks, Moe. I'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yes. You are right, Milhouse. It is a fake. Which makes it a fake I.D."
0,Homer Simpson,"Come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. Oh, I can do it faster that that."
0,Homer Simpson,Jury duty. I'll see that Quimby kid hang for this.
3,Bart Simpson,What's with these people? Why are they sitting on their hands?
0,Homer Simpson,No! You've gotta be sober for this. Gimme that!
0,Homer Simpson,"Sure it is, honey. You do mean stealing, don't you?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"What about my cat, Snowball?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Cut me some slack, I'm a widow."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Whew! I thought it was an inventory issue. That's a big relief. Now don't worry, I'll let 'em down easy. In four years!"
1,Marge Simpson,It's Patty who chose the life of celibacy. Selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her.
3,Bart Simpson,He eats fifty dollars' worth of Power Sauce bars a day.
0,Homer Simpson,"That's right, sweetie. It always comes from corporate."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, well, this is... um... the, uh... the Listen Lady!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, poor Maggie."
0,Homer Simpson,The math checks out!
1,Marge Simpson,Maybe!
0,Homer Simpson,"C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, like people in New Jersey have never seen a fat man makin' out. It's on the freakin' state flag."
3,Bart Simpson,"Goodbye, friends."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Sorry, Nelson. Poor boys such as yourself will go hungry. Now please welcome the star of ""Stuffwich's"" ads, who lost four hundred pounds eating only ""Stuffwich"" subs -- Ezra."
1,Marge Simpson,I heard a noise outside and thought it might be Homer.
8,Ned Flanders,Stop gleaming that cube!
1,Marge Simpson,You lost five percent of your brain.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Curse that ""Groovy Granny""! This is America. Justice should favor the rich!"
3,Bart Simpson,OR TOMORROW WE WILL PAY!
5,Lisa Simpson,THERE! IS EVERYBODY HAPPY NOW?!
0,Homer Simpson,"Good morning, partner!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Y'know, Marge, I've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that I'm really a lucky guy."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Nothing, nothing. There's nothing eating me up inside."
3,Bart Simpson,"Grampa, we've been spending so much time together, I almost feel like you're part of the family."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Nah, let's try it. It might be fun. Is it DNA?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Vendetta? What's that, an Italian vending machine?"
1,Marge Simpson,"This has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. I'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, Montreal Morn."
3,Bart Simpson,"Ohhh, Homer, you old honey dripper."
5,Lisa Simpson,How'd you do that?
1,Marge Simpson,Such a good baby! You deserve some ice cream.
6,Grampa Simpson,I'm not gonna die today.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, look who the new pet is!"
1,Marge Simpson,I don't care who started it. I don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. We love you both. You're not in competition with each other. Repeat. You are not in competition with each other.
1,Marge Simpson,We heard! Isn't it wonderful? We have some great plans for that money.
10,Krusty the Clown,Is it the Jewish thing? 'Cause I can change that. I'm Carlton Witherspoon the third. Where's my five iron?
0,Homer Simpson,But she said I...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Milhouse, I'm impressed."
1,Marge Simpson,Some celery with cream cheese on it?
1,Marge Simpson,Stop all this pandering!
9,Moe Szyslak,I think he'll do just fine.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, hey, you're taking our grease!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, my liver hurts."
3,Bart Simpson,Why don't they look anything like their names?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, lookin' good, Bart."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, you know I had a gambling problem."
0,Homer Simpson,Lousy American-made dog!
0,Homer Simpson,It's working! Buck's buying my fake message! And you said it would never work.
0,Homer Simpson,Wha?!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"This is the last time I pay the price for the irritating mortality of the human worker! Smithers, it's time to re-staff with the super-intelligent kangaroos we've been breeding!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Perhaps I'm not making myself clear. I think you should reconsider.
10,Krusty the Clown,And the monkey-head mittens!
11,Seymour Skinner,No! It was heaven! My vision of heaven!
11,Seymour Skinner,Blast! I took mother's makeup kit by mistake.
1,Marge Simpson,"I had a feeling you'd say that. So I prepared something that might help you ""change your tune."""
7,Chief Wiggum,"Heh, forty-eight dollars and seventy cents... You know we don't usually take rusty money."
0,Homer Simpson,So you want me to go to college?
5,Lisa Simpson,That doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report. What if the weatherman is wrong?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Your work has really inspired me, Doctor. And I love your sensible ponytail."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hello, Moe's Tavern -- birthplace of the Rob Roy."
3,Bart Simpson,"What about you, Chief? Don't you want to be free like the eagle?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Or from your point of view, M and S... Maggie Simpson."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, you can use it!"
3,Bart Simpson,Shaddap!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,With this film.
1,Marge Simpson,"No, no. That's the noise the phone makes when you've been on too long. Bye now! Love you."
1,Marge Simpson,"And Lord, if you think I'm making lemon bars for your bake sale Sunday, you'd better stop killing our cats."
8,Ned Flanders,I'll throw in some Christian comic books!
8,Ned Flanders,Oops! That's for me. Flancrest Enterprises is my home business.
9,Moe Szyslak,"After this, ain't no turning back."
3,Bart Simpson,"Then the zombies will eat you first, and you won't have to watch 'em eat us."
7,Chief Wiggum,Bad hair day.
0,Homer Simpson,"You're outta here, drug-o."
3,Bart Simpson,Except to all of America's problems.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh of course you'd say something like that, Marge. You've hated Ned for years. In fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe."
1,Marge Simpson,You can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking.
1,Marge Simpson,This doesn't make any sense. There was a wedding. You exchanged vows.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh yeah, let's see where that goes."
0,Homer Simpson,"That's right. And I implore you to move your concert to our town. Don't play Olde Springfield, or as it is sometimes known, Sun City."
6,Grampa Simpson,Your mother dragged us both to that God-forsaken lovefest...
0,Homer Simpson,There's gonna be a breakout tonight.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Well, tell her her rump's as big as a queen's and twice as fragrant."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Mattingly, I thought I told you to trim those sideburns. Go home! You're off the team! For good!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, it's for all your charity work and, uh, for, ah, you know, teaching us um... to love again."
3,Bart Simpson,Uh oh!
5,Lisa Simpson,"""You are the shining light that gets me through my darkest hours. For further communication I will require more beans. I love you, baby."""
5,Lisa Simpson,"Sideshow Bob used to be Krusty the Clown's sidekick. But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed robbery and Bart got him put in jail."
3,Bart Simpson,"Jawohl, mein mommandant."
3,Bart Simpson,"Vroom vroom. Vroom vroom... Vroom, vroom."
1,Marge Simpson,And just what might that be?
1,Marge Simpson,"I love you, too."
0,Homer Simpson,"Now all you need are customers. Well, better get home to the little woman."
7,Chief Wiggum,Whaddya suppose the rent is on a hideout like that?
1,Marge Simpson,"Oooh, there's Krusty the Clown! Krusty, Krusty, say something funny."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm not in good hands! I'm in no hands! Like a bad neighbor, no one is there!"
0,Homer Simpson,"How 'bout it, Bart? Would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh yeah? Who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom, ""President Clown""?"
6,Grampa Simpson,Unless you got any heroin.
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw man, five days without pranking. I'm getting strange red marks."
0,Homer Simpson,You see? I'm finally thin enough to wrap this thing around my arm.
1,Marge Simpson,"""Beat, Slay, Shove."""
3,Bart Simpson,Woo! Springfield rocks!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"No, Waylon Senior! It could be filled with atoms and steam and other nuclear bric-a-brac."
0,Homer Simpson,People called him the sixth Simpson. Not sure why.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Huh, uh. Well, it sounds interesting."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sweet Conclusions Break-Up Service. Oh yes, we dispose of your loved one humanely - thanks to our patented TenderDump System."
1,Marge Simpson,We've already been to room 915. We've already filled out form 1790.
8,Ned Flanders,"So, uh, we were talkin' about why you decided to drop in to the ""Flanders arms."""
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, I have some ideas for ways we can improve the classroom experience."
1,Marge Simpson,"Actually, I don't know if I've ever heard Bart play one of your albums--"
0,Homer Simpson,"You're pushing your luck, pal."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, Dad. / Yeah. / We love you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, when you're married to a midnight towboy, you might not see him for days on end."
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, I spend all day alone with Maggie... and sometimes it's like I don't even exist."
9,Moe Szyslak,"That's right, you're workin' in the kitchen. That's how our camp pays the bills."
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, your school requires you to give everyone a Valentine card in an envelope with a fun sticker. Your teacher put out an email alert... with a video attachment."
0,Homer Simpson,"Woo hoo! What's next? A contract with Groove-tone Records? Take the G-train, baby. Groove-tone!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"My Dearest, let me be the first to offer you the hearty handshake that would've climaxed our own wedding day--"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, yeah, the plan went off without a hitch."
1,Marge Simpson,I knew it was serious when he said he didn't want ice cream.
1,Marge Simpson,You Brickyard Bimbo!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Which side won, good or evil?"
0,Homer Simpson,You're the only one who won't shut up about it.
9,Moe Szyslak,Off a tall building. That's a great way to do it!
0,Homer Simpson,"Dear Lord, as I think of you, dressed in white with your splendid beard, I am reminded of Colonel Sanders, who is now seated at your right hand, shoveling popcorn chicken into thy mouth. Lord, could you come up with a delicious new taste treat like he did? I command you!"
1,Marge Simpson,Have you kids seen your father? Surprised he's not here ogling these girls.
5,Lisa Simpson,Want some more smoothie?
5,Lisa Simpson,What do I save?!
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, something else..."
0,Homer Simpson,Then don't.
0,Homer Simpson,I don't know... date a chick with kids...
0,Homer Simpson,Aww. You called me dad.
6,Grampa Simpson,"That Quimby fella promised to build us a Matlock Expressway! How you gonna top that, smart guy?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Just like me!
3,Bart Simpson,Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace?
5,Lisa Simpson,But he does look lonely all by himself...
0,Homer Simpson,It's from Moe!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Here's some orthodontic wax!
1,Marge Simpson,You're being ridiculous.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Then let me do my ""Dutch oven"" bit. It's about other Dutchmen, not you."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Leave your body, Seymour. Leave your body."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh look, here's a coupon for scissors that you have to cut out. Think, geniuses."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I just noticed something: you're not upset enough about this."
9,Moe Szyslak,"It's against hospital regulations, dammit! And Clive Dancer's just waitin' for me to slip up."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, if you don't want to have a babysitter, maybe you should stop being such a baby."
0,Homer Simpson,You're on!
7,Chief Wiggum,My mistake was grabbing the cheese.
1,Marge Simpson,"Stanley stop, or I'll tell Stella."
3,Bart Simpson,Got one.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, if you'd been here for the design phase, you could've registered that objection. Now start quilting!"
0,Homer Simpson,I am so excited I couldn't fall asleep! I even took some pills I found on the floor and still nothing!
5,Lisa Simpson,Don't give up! I'm sure we'll find something!
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry honey, the song I wrote you is so schmaltzy, it'll make ""Moon River"" sound like a farting Orangutan."
0,Homer Simpson,"I hate my job. I mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"If I didn't know better, I'd swear Bob was building a dam."
0,Homer Simpson,Then I'll whomp him with my hat.
11,Seymour Skinner,"They sure are. ""A"" plus!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Nor will we have the chance to marvel at number one draft pick Muk Mu, the human North Pole."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh. I'll just be another minute, John. Have a seat."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, you have to choose. And I think the choice is clear."
0,Homer Simpson,You're nuts. I gotta get some fresh air.
5,Lisa Simpson,"If you think it's so great, why don't you join the band?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, can I go to a rap concert? Tickets are fifty dollars."
10,Krusty the Clown,"I won't let you down. Well, I might let you down on Silly Sailor."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"And, if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours."
5,Lisa Simpson,Kent.
8,Ned Flanders,What about Sodom and Gomorrah?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, you're a genius!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Jeez, Homer, I never seen a guy stand up to that kinda punishment -- I mean, you took a three-man poundin' and didn't ever fall down."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow. I assumed The Jackson Five were the only perfect family, but now I see there's another."
3,Bart Simpson,Lisa can't be a magician -- that's my thing! I'm the one that got a magic set for Christmas two years ago.
0,Homer Simpson,"So, why didn't you marry one of your crummy backup dancers?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"So I'm a moron, am I?"
1,Marge Simpson,"And now that I know better, no DVDs for you kids. Just educational television."
0,Homer Simpson,Talk about what? Sports? Bigamy?
10,Krusty the Clown,I just found out I'm not Jewish. I was turned down by all those country clubs for nothing.
0,Homer Simpson,Can't I keep an eye on that kid? He's fabulous.
8,Ned Flanders,What the? I've been using that around the boys!
11,Seymour Skinner,"What a wonderful science fair. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts we could not afford our third place ribbon. Now, in Second Place, Lisa Simpson's grim description of our short-sighted dependence on fossil fuels."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, we have beer in our time!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, listen up. L-listen up! These prestigious wrought-iron security gates are bullet-proof, bomb-proof, and battering ram-resistant. Now..."
1,Marge Simpson,I told you not to pack them!
3,Bart Simpson,"Melody, you're a great girl, but... I see you as more of a sister... and I don't like my sister."
9,Moe Szyslak,Methinks I shan't.
0,Homer Simpson,I guess these days headhunters can be anything.
1,Marge Simpson,How many times do I have to tell you to quit comparing our relationship to the Special Olympics?
1,Marge Simpson,"No Homie, no. I still love you. A lot of couples take separate vacations."
0,Homer Simpson,Uh... some dog could do the operation.
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I'm the President's no-good brother. ""Moochie-moochie."""
0,Homer Simpson,No you don't...
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh Bart, you could use some new underwear too."
3,Bart Simpson,"Lis, I don't get it. Why does Milhouse's happiness make me sad?"
0,Homer Simpson,"This shouldn't be too hard to fix, with the right tools."
0,Homer Simpson,Hilarious joke?
5,Lisa Simpson,You're endorsing Ted Nugent for President?! He's a right-wing rock star who likes everything I hate!
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow. I'm sorry I doubted you before, Dad."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I got a cassette from Mom and Dad! I thought we could listen to it together."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Pass the peas, please."
9,Moe Szyslak,"But where would I get the money to start a new life? And then, opportunity strolled right in the door..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I dreamed I was married to Corey, and we lived on a pony farm...and Corey was always walking around with his shirt off."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Ga-ga. Goo-goo. Your assignment.
3,Bart Simpson,"""To me bestest bud Milhouse, Happy Birthday, Bart."""
0,Homer Simpson,The bed is lifting me! The elevator at work can't even do that! I demand you put me down right after the sex!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, sure he was, Nahasapasa-Imraisin'apervert."
0,Homer Simpson,So many shoppers. Ow! Damn this... ow! Resilient economy.
5,Lisa Simpson,Intendent--
6,Grampa Simpson,Here comes two!
1,Marge Simpson,I'm a little tired. Could we just snuggle again?
10,Krusty the Clown,"And it's all thanks to you, kid. To show my appreciation I'm gonna bring you with me next time I entertain the troops. Warning, they're not American troops."
7,Chief Wiggum,But they seemed so happy.
1,Marge Simpson,"He loves it! He calls me his ""silver belle!"""
0,Homer Simpson,"I think I'm so big. Blah, blah, blah."
8,Ned Flanders,"QUE SERA, SERA / WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE..."
1,Marge Simpson,No excuses! Just do it!
0,Homer Simpson,I like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.
11,Seymour Skinner,And our windfall is all thanks to our dear new friend on the phone.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Hello, there's more. ""In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic..."""
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay. Okay. Think, Homer..."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Another betrayal!
1,Marge Simpson,Stolen?!
8,Ned Flanders,"Okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. Two dads to a raft."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Please, take your time."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I've fallen in love with crosswords!"
3,Bart Simpson,Her pillow's stuck.
0,Homer Simpson,"Your daughterly love saved me, sweetie!"
0,Homer Simpson,Congratulations! Welcome to the Homer Simpson Program.
0,Homer Simpson,"Dad, are you sure you're okay to drive at night?"
7,Chief Wiggum,Crime doesn't take a vacation.
1,Marge Simpson,"But, isn't that a sin?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, right. A baby shot a guy."
0,Homer Simpson,"But Marge, the Gilded Truffle is an intimate, elegant place."
3,Bart Simpson,Pirate booty. What else?
1,Marge Simpson,"Uh-oh. It's Horndog Hank. Well, Nancy knows how to keep him away."
1,Marge Simpson,That's the best review I've gotten. Seriously. These reviews are terrible.
0,Homer Simpson,Can we make this hand high-low?
1,Marge Simpson,I'm beginning to dislike the man with the whip.
3,Bart Simpson,Don't you get it? There is no pizza party. This isn't a helicopter.
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, let's go."
0,Homer Simpson,Come on -- isn't he the guy I bowl with? The black guy?
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Oh, I don't like the sound of that."
0,Homer Simpson,"Later, losers."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"You said it, partner!"
1,Marge Simpson,"You win, kids. Just sleep here tonight and we'll all go back to Springfield tomorrow."
1,Marge Simpson,Are you sure it's safe?
1,Marge Simpson,"Beautiful, huh? Homer and I used to come up here on dates."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,How? Why?
0,Homer Simpson,Uh. I'd better just put it down.
5,Lisa Simpson,No. I'm not gonna be disappointed again.
0,Homer Simpson,Ooh... this time... Ah...
1,Marge Simpson,Thank heavens!
0,Homer Simpson,We left plenty of food so you won't starve.
3,Bart Simpson,I guess that's it. I just can't be educated. I can always get a job testing dangerous food additives.
1,Marge Simpson,All right! Girls night out! Exotic male dancers at the Golden Banana!
9,Moe Szyslak,"My first credit card! Wow, the numbers are all bumpy-like."
3,Bart Simpson,You just made a powerful enemy!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Send in reinforcements!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hell, yes."
10,Krusty the Clown,now let's welcome Springfield's original God couple. Reverend Lovejoy and Ned Flanders!
3,Bart Simpson,"Nah, I don't do that anymore."
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, quick. Screw these back on."
3,Bart Simpson,"Slowly, slowly -- the RV dealer is across town under that gorilla blimp."
1,Marge Simpson,"Whew, sure is hot out here..."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Look, I just want the horse to have a good home, or be food. You want to take him, fine with me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Will you duel, or are you a coward?!"
0,Homer Simpson,All over the floor.
5,Lisa Simpson,I remind you of you?
0,Homer Simpson,And thank you for assuming we're hip.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,What!?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Jackanapes... lolligaggers... noodle heads... enchantress!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I'm gonna faint!
0,Homer Simpson,Tut-tut. Only the best for my family.
0,Homer Simpson,Huh. I was wrong.
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh, sorry, but I promised to rewind videotapes for the poor."
0,Homer Simpson,"Absolutely. Our third Sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. Where's some place fun we can take Grampa next time?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you knew this day was coming."
1,Marge Simpson,"Now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender."
5,Lisa Simpson,An F. An F! I hope Harvard never finds out about this.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Listen here... I want to join your team.
3,Bart Simpson,"No, my dog!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Look, Mom. There he is."
0,Homer Simpson,You know... maybe I should call in sick. We could visit all our old romantic haunts that have closed and turned into temporary Halloween stores.
0,Homer Simpson,Really? Would you say I was magnetic?
3,Bart Simpson,"Um, Nelson, I was just thinking about us being ""best friends."""
0,Homer Simpson,"Gentlemen, say hello to Springfield's newest supermodel!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I found something awesome in the woods.
3,Bart Simpson,"Earth base, this is commander Bart McCool. We are under attack by the Zorrinid Brain Changers! Quickly, into the safety dome, Milbot!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Yeah. The sun is still out.
0,Homer Simpson,This room just got a whole lot cooler.
1,Marge Simpson,What on earth was that?
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, and I could really use your help."
9,Moe Szyslak,Dammit! I just had to get her parkour lessons for her birthday.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'm gonna need some help getting this off."
6,Grampa Simpson,That was a magical summer...
1,Marge Simpson,Did you just vomit in that suit?
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, I don't have time for childish games. If I don't do my job, atoms go boom!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Maya... there's something I wanna ask ya, um... I don't know why I'm so nervous... this makes more sense than anything I've ever done... well, other than keepin' all my Netflix movies and sayin' the post office lost 'em. Anyway..."
11,Seymour Skinner,Whew. Mercy. Good evening. Our old friend Noah Webster defines laughter as the act or sound of laughing--
1,Marge Simpson,"""Eat, Pray, Love."""
3,Bart Simpson,"Otto, why don't you come home with me? You can stay in our garage."
0,Homer Simpson,"Now that you're all relaxed... Most of us here were born in America. We take this country for granted. But not immigrants like Apu. While the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid, they're driving the cabs that get us home safely..."
8,Ned Flanders,This is a whole new relationship for us! We'll be friends! In this life and the next!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Sundance, the preeminent independent film festival held each January in Park City Utah?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, what am I gonna do?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie! You're alive!"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Sure, sure."
0,Homer Simpson,Fellow Springfielders. I have called you all here so we can enter the Duff Book of World Records.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Um, it's a lot worse than a stray dog."
0,Homer Simpson,You're the doctor.
11,Seymour Skinner,Where do you think you're going?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, he's establishing mood."
5,Lisa Simpson,You've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you. Why would she leave you now?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I mean Simon...
1,Marge Simpson,I'm starting to worry about your father.
0,Homer Simpson,I don't know -- the back yard?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, you schmuck -- get off-a me!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Oh, so that was a tire iron poking me in the back. Oh, that clears up a lot."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Lower and likelier.
1,Marge Simpson,Oh! The little tiger tries so hard. Why does he keep failing?
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, where'd that painting come from?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Uh, yeah, I need someone to help me with the midnight beer delivery. Your job is to distract Barney until it's safely off the truck."
0,Homer Simpson,Hmmm...
6,Grampa Simpson,So I decided to take matters into my own hands.
3,Bart Simpson,Who knows? But it sure is easy. I'll walk you through it. All you have to do is--
0,Homer Simpson,"We don't need to do that, Marge. I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all."
0,Homer Simpson,What about my family?
0,Homer Simpson,Anybody else? Come on...
11,Seymour Skinner,Why did you say that to us in the meanest way you could?
0,Homer Simpson,Sorry I'm late! I was just gathering my counseling equipment.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,It's weird to see you as somebody's sidekick.
0,Homer Simpson,What's a Tim Conway?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Oh my God! I said I didn't care if they ever came back! This is my fault!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, this one's cold!"
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm gonna pour caramel on my clothes. And then, finally, I can eat my shorts."
5,Lisa Simpson,They gave you a chopper?!
0,Homer Simpson,It's not even noon.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, go back to the garage."
0,Homer Simpson,The pig?
9,Moe Szyslak,Three nines.
3,Bart Simpson,No! Why in the world would you get me this?
5,Lisa Simpson,"You were born while they were married so legally, no. But in the sense someone calls you one when they're angry, yes."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Hey. These don't work.
5,Lisa Simpson,"But Dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, just settle down. We just got a postcard from Maggie."
0,Homer Simpson,Stay away from my wife!
0,Homer Simpson,"No, don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware! I WAS UNAWAAARE!"
0,Homer Simpson,Unloved by Al? Noooooooo!
1,Marge Simpson,Hurry up! I want to get Grampa back here by three so we can get him and Maggie on the same nap schedule.
0,Homer Simpson,Daddy...
0,Homer Simpson,Uh-uh! No way! I'm not sharing my bed with anybody except you! And maybe that guy. Lincoln-style. But that's it.
0,Homer Simpson,"Awww, crap!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, Barney. See the row of tiny lights up there? The middle one is my house. Someone must have left the porch light on."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I love those kids! They've got such a great attitude!"
3,Bart Simpson,Got that right.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, everybody."
3,Bart Simpson,"Just Bart will be fine, sir."
3,Bart Simpson,You really think my shirts will sell?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in hope."
3,Bart Simpson,"Um Mom, where are we?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Boy, this key opens everything."
3,Bart Simpson,You're right. I'll do it.
0,Homer Simpson,Phew. Now all we have to do is get out before the concrete hardens.
0,Homer Simpson,"It's okay, they're with me."
0,Homer Simpson,YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET...
0,Homer Simpson,"I don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ned, I'm an American tourist. I'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my Carolina Panthers credit card."
1,Marge Simpson,"If you don't want to die alone, come out of your room!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, the only other one to apply was Moe Syszlak, and his stuff scares the hell out of me."
0,Homer Simpson,It must be the first of the month! New billboard day!
9,Moe Szyslak,That comes in kid sizes too.
3,Bart Simpson,He's a robot. We saw him on the way in.
11,Seymour Skinner,"So, Edna, I uh, I wrote up some possible discussion topics for this trip. Oh, here's one: I'm still in love with you. Discuss?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Who's up for some exploring?
10,Krusty the Clown,That'd be great! Are you sure that's Kah-sher?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Happy Halloween, everybody!"
3,Bart Simpson,Ready?
10,Krusty the Clown,I don't need laughs!
1,Marge Simpson,"No, Homer, not over this. No, no."
3,Bart Simpson,But I can't squeal. It would violate the code of the school yard.
6,Grampa Simpson,"If it's all the same to you, I'll take on those bulls."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, can we go to Banana Republic? There's a mannequin there I have a crush on."
1,Marge Simpson,"That's odd. He's outside, digging."
5,Lisa Simpson,Yes! A Maggie-oop!
8,Ned Flanders,It's the name of the freezer!
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay Lisa, comin' up to make things better!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, he would eat all the time. We'd be making love, and he'd have a mouth full of Hershey's Miniatures."
9,Moe Szyslak,Al?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, what'll I do, Moe?"
3,Bart Simpson,"How is it ""accidentally"" when this is the fifth time?"
6,Grampa Simpson,See? That's your problem. You're a crab. Ladies like sweet talkers.
5,Lisa Simpson,Or a big joke.
5,Lisa Simpson,I guess the hunt was more fun than the catch.
1,Marge Simpson,I feel good... with no repercussions!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, I'm a little busy, Homer. Ah, you can pour it yourself."
1,Marge Simpson,"Good. I'm glad. And that's what makes me cool -- not caring, right?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie! You did care."
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, quit playing that back."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I see. Well, what if I cover you all with... a cube of bulletproof plexi-glass!"
0,Homer Simpson,You can't kick me out. It'll cause a miscount in the census. A miscount!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Look, Janey, cupcakes."
3,Bart Simpson,Wait! I've got an idea!
0,Homer Simpson,The what?
0,Homer Simpson,It's good! It's good! It's good!
0,Homer Simpson,Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine. I--
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, you want my keys?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, our baby pictures were in there!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Gentlemen, the game is capture the flag. Rod, ladies pick first."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey Marge, watch me burn Flanders. Ned Flanders bids fifty dollars."
0,Homer Simpson,What are the skits about?
1,Marge Simpson,I've got a bad feeling about this. Let's check the suit closet.
0,Homer Simpson,Hello? Yeah he's here who is this? Bart's friend Milhouse. Bart! Get your butt down here!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, don't act like Mussolini!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Well sir, sounds fair. Toodle-oo, everybody. I'll, I'll scream when the comet gets here."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, I know how we can save Bart."
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah. What have you done with the real Moe?
3,Bart Simpson,"Yes, sir. Because I killed an innocent bird."
1,Marge Simpson,"That's great, Homie! Come have some ice cream on a brownie!"
0,Homer Simpson,Well what?
0,Homer Simpson,"Stop it, both of you! Don't make me drive into that tree! You know I will!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Less chat, more hat."
0,Homer Simpson,No.
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm not saying you're a bad inventor. I'm just saying these particular inventions are awful, and no one in their right mind would buy them. Or accept them as gifts."
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah that's good.
5,Lisa Simpson,Really? Let me see!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, can it?"
5,Lisa Simpson,My third husband bought me this.
1,Marge Simpson,My main finger?
1,Marge Simpson,Just one M & M.
1,Marge Simpson,He's not dead.
1,Marge Simpson,"Hello? Tennessee State Police? No, my son's car was not crushed in Knoxville. I don't know where to begin telling you what's wrong with that."
1,Marge Simpson,"It's not a real car, Grampa."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Wow, did you see that yaw control?"
1,Marge Simpson,You were given six weeks to live. And you've outlived it! I think what kept you alive was that for once in your life you were helping other people.
0,Homer Simpson,"No, you're a-wrong!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Nah, nah, nah, no luxury items. Just the face."
5,Lisa Simpson,Is a coma painful?
11,Seymour Skinner,Good Lord! My Stormin' Norman Commemorative Plates stolen... again.
1,Marge Simpson,But now it can have a second meaning.
0,Homer Simpson,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, who said anything about a jar?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Uh, Superintendent Chalmers! What's wrong?!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Good evening, everyone, and welcome to a wonderful evening of theater and picking up after yourselves."
0,Homer Simpson,Prove it. What happens to Homer Simpson in the future?
1,Marge Simpson,"Great stuff, Ned."
0,Homer Simpson,That's not as fun as it looks.
0,Homer Simpson,"If they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then ""no."""
3,Bart Simpson,He made it!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh yeah, my two kids. Screw... and you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm only human. Now look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll unload the kids on Patty and Selma Saturday night. And then we'll eat until they kick us out of the place. Just like old times."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, Lis, what do you think about the alien now?"
5,Lisa Simpson,It smells like Otto's jacket.
0,Homer Simpson,"Assistant? Well, I have been pretty overworked lately."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Happy birthday, Bart."
0,Homer Simpson,"See, honey, Daddy's protecting you from all the sharp scary things. Here, hold this a sec."
3,Bart Simpson,And I'm happy to listen to F.M. ninety-five point three. Home of Boomer and the Diz!
1,Marge Simpson,No idea. The important thing is that they did.
3,Bart Simpson,You got that right.
1,Marge Simpson,"I promise I will get mad, because I always do when you make me promise I won't."
0,Homer Simpson,Yay! / All right! / Woo-hoo! /

1,Marge Simpson,"Moe, it's me, Marge! I'm your friend!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yummy, yumma!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Normally I wouldn't ask, but it's an emergency. Mother has a Junebug cornered in the basement and she needs me to finish it off. C'mon, chop chop."
0,Homer Simpson,All right! Woo woo! Woo woo!
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, can't hear you, Marge. I'm clapping."
1,Marge Simpson,Shh! This bully friend of yours... Is he a little on the chunky side?
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute... Mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. Mom! You used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Who's joking?!! Oh, I don't know what you're saying! It all sounds so crazy to me!!"
1,Marge Simpson,Forwards?
3,Bart Simpson,"EVERY TEDDY BEAR WHO'S BEEN GOOD IS SURE OF A TREAT TODAY/ THERE'S LOTS OF MARVELOUS THINGS TO EAT, AND WONDERFUL GAMES TO PLAY/ BENEATH THE TREES, WHERE NOBODY SEES/ THEY'LL HIDE AND SEEK AS LONG AS THEY PLEASE/ TODAY'S THE DAY THE TEDDY BEARS HAVE THEIR PICNIC!"

8,Ned Flanders,"Get rid of Dr. Fuzzenstein? Why, I couldn't dream of thinking about considering..."
0,Homer Simpson,"And if anything happens to me, I want you bullies to take care of my boy."
1,Marge Simpson,Which was?

1,Marge Simpson,"Ooo, looks like something exciting's happening. Well, we'll have to read about it in tomorrow's paper."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm signing us up for a reality show where we trade you to another family.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well I'm glad you did a good deed, but you shouldn't come here again. I thought that was strange poop on your collar."

1,Marge Simpson,For you. For you.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Actually, son, it's a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xt'tapalatakettle, the god of war."
1,Marge Simpson,What was that? Was that a yes or a no?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Oh, the Zoomanity!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Look, it's Tony Bennett!"
1,Marge Simpson,"You're my rock, Homie."
9,Moe Szyslak,I hustled a lot of pool.
0,Homer Simpson,Lousy job. Nothing exciting ever happens.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Quiet, Grampa. Hello... Mom?!?!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Even better! They're bags of seeds, so that you can plant a garden and watch it grow."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Oh blessed urchin! How can I reward you?
1,Marge Simpson,And don't make that face at me.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Now we give them the bikes, no one sues."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, how could you? We were connecting in such a meaningful way."
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm... I'm sorry, but I'm not your mother."
7,Chief Wiggum,"That's the signal. Take the boot off the car, boys."
5,Lisa Simpson,No you haven't!
5,Lisa Simpson,You really want me?
6,Grampa Simpson,"Will and ""Shorts"". Two things I'm no longer allowed to change by myself."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, the doctor says that soon my pelvis will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever."

0,Homer Simpson,Do you think he noticed?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Not dramatic enough.
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw, come on. If you're really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I make six of those a year."
0,Homer Simpson,I was right.
3,Bart Simpson,Who would've thought that our visit to Itchy and Scratchy Land would turn out to be our best vacation ever.

9,Moe Szyslak,"Watch it with the attitude, Mister. You came from my back fat!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Dis-embroider the crew jackets. We can still send them back.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh baby, that's all I needed to hear."

8,Ned Flanders,WHO CAN?
6,Grampa Simpson,"Whaddya say we roll on the grass, son?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Gee, Artie. Artie wait. I don't know. I mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah. That was brilliant."
3,Bart Simpson,...and I'm not feeling the rush.
3,Bart Simpson,"Principal Skinner?! This is bogus, man. You know the rules: two letters and a conference before I get a home visit."
3,Bart Simpson,Who?
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, and then we'd get the chair."
0,Homer Simpson,You butcher!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, enjoy your game and the madcap antics of the free-wheeling title-holder of this asset: me!"

1,Marge Simpson,Don't burn her! She's just an innocent child!
3,Bart Simpson,"Mrs. Krabappel, we're all upset by the untimely deaths of Stinky and Wrinkles. But life goes on. So, if I could just have my yo-yo back..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah... Hello, there, uh... uh..."
3,Bart Simpson,"Some gentle rocking will relax you, Mom."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay book, I didn't read you, and you didn't read me, but we're both in this together, so say something smart or get ready to run like hell. Um... ""In business as in breakfast, fried eggs have fragile yolks... huh, huh?"

0,Homer Simpson,Can we at least get some French fries?
1,Marge Simpson,Hmmm. I was going to wash my hair.

0,Homer Simpson,You can't win us back with mere donuts.
1,Marge Simpson,"But, why would the Advisory Board give us bad advice?"
5,Lisa Simpson,I can't. My Mom's not picking me up for an hour.
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, Junior. I expect this to be fixed with quality GM parts."
3,Bart Simpson,Are you putting feces on the tip?
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, who wants dinner?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"You know, we could get equipment like this through a bond issue."
1,Marge Simpson,I'm third generation.

3,Bart Simpson,True or false: You can get mono from riding the monorail?
1,Marge Simpson,I've opened up my house to you. And all you do is fill this joyous season with petty complaints.
0,Homer Simpson,How do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. But somehow I just never made it to the big time."
3,Bart Simpson,Mom! How can you leave us with this maniac?!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Release the hounds!
0,Homer Simpson,Maybe Marge would forgive me if I won the lotto. Give me a scratcher.
3,Bart Simpson,Go away!
5,Lisa Simpson,Sour grapes.
8,Ned Flanders,"I don't know, neighboreenos, I'm all for Halloween fun, but a sÃ©ance sounds a little PG-13."
5,Lisa Simpson,My job: making you look good.
1,Marge Simpson,Don't you have any rooms? We can't live in our house for six months.
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, pal. We've got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy ""Radioactive Man No. 1"". So why don't you just waddle over there and get it."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Bart, Bart! We're in whatchamacallit... a pursuit!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well, where do I twist this thing to make funny patterns?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Uh-oh. Bart, you better talk to Mom and Dad about this."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, and along the way we took photos of interesting doors and gates."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, c'mon, I'll make a fortune for one night's work! We could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --"
3,Bart Simpson,"Tough break, dad. I guess people just weren't ready for Poochie. Maybe in a few years."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Since I've never seen you before, maybe it is your first day. Very well, carry on."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, pal. Like the way you handle that mop. You like killing? Hey, ladies. Are you tired of waiting for sanctions to work? I know I am."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way. We were planning a surprise party for you."
8,Ned Flanders,"Okilly-dokilly, let's put on our game faces."

2,C. Montgomery Burns,Silence! Or I'll chop you into suet for my murderous gerbils and hamsters.
0,Homer Simpson,Stupid lawn chair!
0,Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? What can you old people do to us?
0,Homer Simpson,How could Tony cheat on me so soon?

4,Milhouse Van Houten,Oh man!
3,Bart Simpson,"Dear Lisa. Psych. Psych, psych, psych. Signed, Super-psych."

1,Marge Simpson,"Sorry, force of habit. Lisa, no!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, do laundry."

8,Ned Flanders,I think we should leave.
0,Homer Simpson,"Y'know, I always felt sorry for Marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun."

0,Homer Simpson,"Ah, sounds delightful. Just you and me and the balladeers."
8,Ned Flanders,"Doggone it, Eve, I think you'd better hightail it outta this Garden!"

10,Krusty the Clown,I don't know any Bart Simpson.
11,Seymour Skinner,"I caught your son defacing school property this morning. We estimate the damage at seventy-five dollars and, frankly, we think it's terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill."

3,Bart Simpson,Lisa's counting on me for this coolness report.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,--and they can also bloody well change back!
1,Marge Simpson,"Um, you're just having a bad day. I had one last week. I burned the roast, my cake fell, and I ran out of butter so I had to spray the English muffins with PAM."
1,Marge Simpson,"Doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, Bart, you'd see how sane he is."
0,Homer Simpson,"I know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, I'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it."

0,Homer Simpson,"Here you go, honey. That's about all the recycling I can handle today."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I've had one of my unpredictable changes of heart. Seeing these fine young athletes reveling in the humiliation of a vanquished foe... I haven't felt this energized since my last... boweling.
0,Homer Simpson,"Look at me, I'm afraid of dying!"
0,Homer Simpson,Don't lie to me boy.

5,Lisa Simpson,"Picture yourself on a beautiful sailboat. Ahhh, can't you just feel the sea breeze in your hair?... or scalps?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Me too. I'm a member of this club where if I eat one more sub sandwich, I get a free sub sandwich. You probably saw the ads, with this guy who used to be fat, but now he's just ugly."

9,Moe Szyslak,"Well, I do know this one couple -- the Simpsons I believe their name is -- that ain't too judgmental. She's a standup dame and he's a fall-down drunk. We'll make a double date of it. Now, let's get back to what we were..."
3,Bart Simpson,You hug the bedpost. Then I hug the bedpost. That way we never hug each other.

2,C. Montgomery Burns,Hello lamp post/ Whatcha knowin'? / I've come to watch your power flowing.

10,Krusty the Clown,"Yeah, I've seen all the overnight sensations -- Brad Hall, Rich Hall, Rich Little, Little Richard -- but the Simpsons blew 'em all away. They even had a hit record. Meanwhile, ""Krustophenia"" sits on the shelf."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Fistface? Who's Fistface? Why won't you tell me who Fistface is? I demand you reveal the identity of Fistface!
0,Homer Simpson,Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.

9,Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, now wait just a minute. One thing Moe Szyslak has never had is a partner. Nor a wife, a friend, a chum, a casual acquaintance, a pen pal, a parrot, a meaningful conversation, a brief hug or eye contact."
1,Marge Simpson,"You remember Dylan. You were in ""Toddle Tots"" together."
1,Marge Simpson,"Two hundred. No! No! I mean, I mean nothing. I don't take bribes."
0,Homer Simpson,I was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.
0,Homer Simpson,"You know Marge, joining the reserves was the best thing I ever did. I feel good about myself, I'm helping my country, and later, I'm gonna get Gilligan's autograph."
3,Bart Simpson,Hmm. Hmm. Hey...

5,Lisa Simpson,You did that to help me out!
0,Homer Simpson,"Um... No problem, sweetie."
5,Lisa Simpson,Doctor?

4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Yeah, well I work better in a structured environment."

0,Homer Simpson,"Hmm. Fabulous house. Well-behaved kids. Sisters-in-law dead. Luxury sedan. Woo hoo! I hit the jackpot. Marge, dear. Would you kindly pass me a donut?"

1,Marge Simpson,"I don't hate you, I'm proud of you. You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most."
0,Homer Simpson,In one car? With no air conditioning? And the little poop machine going every twenty minutes?

1,Marge Simpson,"So, you kids really love the Leader, huh? Even more than your parents?"

0,Homer Simpson,"You know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man."
5,Lisa Simpson,I think he swallowed the remote.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Cigarettes?! They could kill you. They did a whole episode about it on ""The Suite Life of Zach and Cody""! Zach tried to impress a girl by smoking. But she went for Cody instead! Zach's life wasn't so sweet then."
0,Homer Simpson,Those bastards...
3,Bart Simpson,He might have been a temp. Very surly.

0,Homer Simpson,Just sign your name above President Lincoln's.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hee, hee, hee, hee. That is funny."
3,Bart Simpson,"All the beer from the landfill is gone, Beer Baron. We're out of business."
0,Homer Simpson,Hey! I called that! I saw it first! Come back here!
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet."
1,Marge Simpson,"Really? But the franchise agreement says Mother Hubbard Inc. would provide adequate training for all employees, which they didn't. Clause twenty-seven C-3."
0,Homer Simpson,"No, actually, I'm going to eat twice as much."
0,Homer Simpson,Yes it is. It's very good and you're a good little baby. Yes you are.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Moe's Tavern, presided over by Moe Szyslak -- handsome, suave, debonair..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Wrong. All beer trucks heading towards Springfield have been diverted. This town will be as dry as a bone. And if the rest of you beer swilling tube jockeys out there have a problem with this, talk to Homer Simpson."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh well, you'd be surprised."
9,Moe Szyslak,O-Oh! Oh! Homer! How -- could you?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, that'd be great! Sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... It'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store."
0,Homer Simpson,It should be Gary Oldman!
9,Moe Szyslak,"So, I guess you didn't eat that ""special cheese"" that I gave you yesterday, huh?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's going on? That guy's not Homer Simpson. He's fat and stupid."
9,Moe Szyslak,Nobody gets away from Moe. Nobody!
10,Krusty the Clown,I did find out one fact -- she was a guy!
1,Marge Simpson,"I don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair. Awful, awful hair."
5,Lisa Simpson,How long is that?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Creatures from another galaxy!
3,Bart Simpson,I passed. I got a D minus. I passed. All right!
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, I don't know how that got in there."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I've learned the robotic worker is no match for the old-fashioned man of labor. You're all hired back... as temps!"
3,Bart Simpson,What he said.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, they can't take our house. My pot-bellied pig is in there."
5,Lisa Simpson,I'd bet my entire college fund on it.
8,Ned Flanders,Less news from the pews!
10,Krusty the Clown,"I think I heard ""usurper of the throne."" Now finally, I need an object."

0,Homer Simpson,"If you say so, M'lord."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I want trouble all right."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well illustrated, Nelson. And now, fasten your funnybones for Groundskeeper -- oh, or should I say Grinskeeper... No, I'm sorry, Groundskeeper was correct -- Willie!"

5,Lisa Simpson,"Milhouse, I'm not sure why you left me in the forest, so I made cookies. But I didn't know what kind you liked, so I made you seven kinds. I've become my mother! Well, common sense never goes out of style That was too easy!"
3,Bart Simpson,"But Lis, when this book comes out, you'll be beloved! Not just by Milhouses, you'll get attention from Jacksons, Xanders -- even Aidens!"
3,Bart Simpson,Yep. I'm at the tennis match.
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh... don't tase me, bro. Chocolate rain!"
3,Bart Simpson,See?! That's my expression!
1,Marge Simpson,"Come spring, they sought help from the Native Americans."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I want to go to bed. Aren't there child labor laws?"
1,Marge Simpson,We're trapped. Your fans will rip us to pieces.
5,Lisa Simpson,Bye Mom!
0,Homer Simpson,"I have an awful confession to make: you didn't crash that car, it was me. I put you behind the wheel and I'm so, so, so sorry."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's how I feel about Notre Dame football."
1,Marge Simpson,"But you need to try things on! Every brand has a different idea of ""Husky."""
1,Marge Simpson,I remember Bart!
1,Marge Simpson,Come down here.
0,Homer Simpson,Cooder! What have you done to our house?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, right -- revenge!!"
1,Marge Simpson,I thought the government sent it to us as part of the stimulus package. At least that's what the letter said.
10,Krusty the Clown,Ah so. Ah so. Me lika da flied lice... Me flappa dickey long time...
3,Bart Simpson,Wow! Wow!!! WOW!!!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey guys, I have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then I'll be back to go to Vegas!"
0,Homer Simpson,"This computer is so great! I'm watching the latest Sofia Coppola movie at ""twenty times"" speed to make it seem like a normal movie."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, how much is it?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, well, we're all out, Homer."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, hello, Marge. I'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. Am I disappointed? Yes. Am I surprised? No."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, I'm sorry, kids. We lost the batteries for that."
1,Marge Simpson,Bowling ball... more underpants...
11,Seymour Skinner,"Okay Bart, since you like attention so much, I have a second announcement."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,You owe us Michael Jackson.
1,Marge Simpson,Homie! You're home early!
6,Grampa Simpson,"Me too! I been doin' 'em since Nineteen fifty-eight -- back then we called 'em ""Alphabet Hotels"", 'cause every letter gets its own little room. I still do the Springfield Shopper puzzle every day!"
1,Marge Simpson,Substantially-less
1,Marge Simpson,"What do you think, Homer?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I hope the next people don't give us anything so we can trick them too!
5,Lisa Simpson,"I still believe in this town... a town that deserves its own original song! And as an aspiring musician with off-Broadway dreams, I'm the one to write it!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"So, I'll hide and you guys count to a hundred."
3,Bart Simpson,Nobody tells Bart Simpson what to do.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony?"
3,Bart Simpson,Buck McCoy.
5,Lisa Simpson,I've gotta go.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"So, the caterpillar has emerged from its cocoon as a shark with a gun for a mouth. I only have one thing to say to that... bravo."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, Marge. We can go to the circus. Maybe I can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Stoats are weasels, Bart. They don't come in cans."
5,Lisa Simpson,NO!
1,Marge Simpson,Hmmm... sometimes I find pickle slices in the sheets.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, why aren't you doing your homework!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Hysterical pregnancy?
3,Bart Simpson,Me neither!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, my special little guy! We were so worried!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hah, hah, nyah, nyah."
1,Marge Simpson,No more Simpsons movies! One was plenty!
0,Homer Simpson,"No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to do some long division."
3,Bart Simpson,You guys lied to us!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it."
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! You can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea.
0,Homer Simpson,What's an e-mail?
8,Ned Flanders,"Praiseland? Rides, food, a tithing pond."
3,Bart Simpson,Aahhh! Unclean! Unclean!
6,Grampa Simpson,I just want to see the look on your faces when I share with you the fruits of a lifetime of labor.
0,Homer Simpson,Then it's settled.
1,Marge Simpson,Why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain?
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer..."
3,Bart Simpson,"Please, just leave me alone!"
6,Grampa Simpson,"So long, lamp. Now stop loafing, and help your Grampa unpack."
7,Chief Wiggum,I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.
7,Chief Wiggum,Yeah?
10,Krusty the Clown,Take out the mother cow. The rest will follow.
0,Homer Simpson,"Maggie, can you say ""daddy""? Dad-dy?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Uh, ""A."" And I'd like to add that proposition ""Hug Lisa For Me"" has my full support."
3,Bart Simpson,Responsibly.
3,Bart Simpson,Jimbo heard me say it. I'm dead.
0,Homer Simpson,"That's not gonna do it, Marge. You need something red."
1,Marge Simpson,Don't muss my hair.
0,Homer Simpson,The foul stench of death is upon us. Mmmm... hamburgers.
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, to the best of my recollection, yes."
1,Marge Simpson,"That reahlly doesn't help, Baht."
8,Ned Flanders,"If I could give you my heart, Homer, I would."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, Dr. Hibbert. Your trust means so much to me."
1,Marge Simpson,Dissin'? Do rappers still say that?
11,Seymour Skinner,First prize... first prize...
3,Bart Simpson,I don't think I really captured the eyes.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, Smithers, when you look at me with those puppy dog eyes... all right."
3,Bart Simpson,Mom's not gonna like this.
1,Marge Simpson,Where did they all go?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. We're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. All those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies."
0,Homer Simpson,They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
8,Ned Flanders,"I sense a ""but"" coming, Reverend..."
0,Homer Simpson,I can't go back to living on the surface world! I can't!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense, young Woosterfield! Your fortune is greater than mine. It is-it is I who am at your service. Smithers! Fetch us some lemonade!"
3,Bart Simpson,I've got something you can stuff in that old bag.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, yeah. Now howzabout introducin' me to that cute little pay phone out front?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Lisa, I know it's frustrating. But we made a commitment and we have to see it through, no matter how unpleasant."
3,Bart Simpson,"'Scuse me, Brother Faith. I gotta know, how did you really get the bucket off my Dad's head?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"And now, I want you to meet the guy who's gonna help bring Moe's into the twentieth century."
0,Homer Simpson,My time being wasted was not wasted!
7,Chief Wiggum,Maybe someone else is here. And maybe he'll step forward and admit to being the real culprit.
3,Bart Simpson,"S'up, sis?"
0,Homer Simpson,My brain's fine! In my dreams I'm an intermediate skier!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Heh. Too bad real women don't come with these, huh?"
3,Bart Simpson,What? No! Not until you raise my allowance.
10,Krusty the Clown,It could happen. Who needs friends? The incessant beep of the Global Positioning System is all the companionship I need.
1,Marge Simpson,On a night like tonight I have to believe there are.
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, ya see, that's what I'm talkin' about. You're always pointing that shotgun at us."
0,Homer Simpson,"If the plant ye wish to flee, go to sector 7-B."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, it's a handgun! Isn't it great? This is the trigger... and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die..."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Uh, don't worry, sir, I'll teach these children some respect for their town. I'm assigning each of you twenty hours of community service."
0,Homer Simpson,Even love is boring when you're stuck in a tunnel of it. Why can't this be the Tunnel of Hockey Fights?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, there are pictures. I keep them where I need the most cheering up."
0,Homer Simpson,"Get this. He said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!"
1,Marge Simpson,I'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Y'know something, Bart? I'm getting tired of things like that."
1,Marge Simpson,Even bonnets?
0,Homer Simpson,I'm really thirty-eight.
3,Bart Simpson,Like a light bulb!
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, looks like somebody sold something today."
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm gonna go get some vegetarian chili before they get desperate and add meat.
0,Homer Simpson,Okay. All right. Okay.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, looks like we got everything for Bart's camping trip: Blair Witch Repellent, antler saw and Deep Woods Scrabble."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, I'd better drag myself to the hospital."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, he fooled almost everyone. But there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh dear God, no."
1,Marge Simpson,I was killed... by my own son.
5,Lisa Simpson,Come on!
3,Bart Simpson,"...And for every syringe I find, I get a dollar."
0,Homer Simpson,"Stay with me, man. Stay with me."
0,Homer Simpson,"You're rejecting me? But I'm in the best shape anyone is, in the nineteen thirties."
1,Marge Simpson,Look who's here. It's this thing!
5,Lisa Simpson,"""Lisa is an outstanding student, with a slight tendency toward know-it-all-ism."" That's not even a word!"
0,Homer Simpson,But what if I were to shake your hand in this wise?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, if my writers knew how to appeal to girls, they wouldn't be writers."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh no, I won a free game!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Boys, you better come in the house. You don't want to get the sniffles."
5,Lisa Simpson,WE'VE GOT A BIG SINKHOLE...
5,Lisa Simpson,Bye!
0,Homer Simpson,The other critics told me to be mean. And you should always give in to peer pressure.
5,Lisa Simpson,"ABC, CBS... uh-oh, the Christian Science Monitor has a flat tire!"
9,Moe Szyslak,Looks like me and Marge are both goin' to Hell. That's when I make my move.
1,Marge Simpson,"So, I got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize."
0,Homer Simpson,"Let us curl, M'lady. Let us throw and sweep a'twain until the Heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! And afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. And if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of November, we shall proclaim that WE WERE CURLING!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"There are perfectly logical explanations for everything that happened. The bonfire sent soot into the air which created rain. And with all the trees cut down, a flood was inevitable."
0,Homer Simpson,You can't not do it!
5,Lisa Simpson,I just wanted to see if there was a better life. Even for a little bit.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, me too."
0,Homer Simpson,I locked my keys in there. Get a rock.
6,Grampa Simpson,Movies! What a rip-off.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,A VH-60N Whitehawk!
1,Marge Simpson,"Hm. I brought you a tuna sandwich. They say it's brain food. I guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I like T-shirts with a nice joke, like ""support our troops."""
3,Bart Simpson,Mmm. Wednesday -- hoagie night.
3,Bart Simpson,"Ew, locusts. Darkness, yawn. Bingo! Flanders, are you willing to get Lovejoy back by hook or by crook?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I didn't say ""stop."""
5,Lisa Simpson,I don't care. Ask Hef over there.
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh my God, she killed him."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that."
3,Bart Simpson,"Mmmm. Great lunches, eh, Lis?"
0,Homer Simpson,Ow! I'll reap! I'll reap already!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, then you shoulda been early."
0,Homer Simpson,I just poured myself a new glass of milk. The old one sat out for a little while. Are you comin' to bed?
3,Bart Simpson,"Lisa, this is your mother."
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, breaking baddies, drop the meth!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Well, Annie, I think you know my answer."
1,Marge Simpson,I think we should take him off the drug.
3,Bart Simpson,What was that?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, this punishment is so cruel."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,No! No! Let me go! Let me go!
5,Lisa Simpson,I waaarned you.
9,Moe Szyslak,"I'll field that. Yesterday, a local man may or may not have given a tour to a certain princess, who, uh, one assumes, turned all his thoughts of revenge to love and then love to respect."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, Marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! And our stopgap solution is getting cranky."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Simpson -- Monty Burns. Come with me.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Martin was a shy, awkward child who will never fulfill his promise to become a weird, unloved adult. The Audio-Visual Club has prepared a video tribute to their fallen associate."
1,Marge Simpson,The dump?
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, give me a break! I don't notice the color of people's eyes! I just judge them on the color of their skin."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Installing an M.H.D. Generator would allow the plant to operate at a higher temperature without the tyranny of moving parts. Using conducting plasma as the moving conductor...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, how does Bart do this every week?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Guess we've all carried the same books, huh, guys?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,...it means the signal is a fake.
0,Homer Simpson,We got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on fire.
0,Homer Simpson,Give me the old stars and stripes.
8,Ned Flanders,"As the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. I spent the whole morning blackin' out the ""goshes"" and ""darns"" in these Hardy Boys books."
5,Lisa Simpson,Our poor couch...
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! I woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me.
3,Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, I gotta have my soul back. I'll do anything you want."
3,Bart Simpson,"Boy, you're back!"
3,Bart Simpson,"So now that we've blown your cover, I guess you've gotta come back and do your show again!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Let's go, Marge. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I didn't know you went to college!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Milhouse! Oh, what's this?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Huh? Ehh, whaddaya want? I'm not gonna do ""A"" material for charity. And after all, that is why we're here."
0,Homer Simpson,Thanks. I still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.
0,Homer Simpson,Why do you think I'm kicking it?
3,Bart Simpson,It's a history lesson come to life.
0,Homer Simpson,"See Marge, everyone says they hate these magazines, but it's impossible to set them down."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, it's like the Allman Brothers!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Honey, there's something I have to tell you..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, he expressed an interest."
1,Marge Simpson,"No! No, I've got a lot more mothering left in me!"
6,Grampa Simpson,You came to see me! Aww! Easter came early this year!
11,Seymour Skinner,No. Absolutely no friction dancing!
5,Lisa Simpson,"This time, he's the lesser of two evils."
1,Marge Simpson,Wait! How do you know this is where Lincoln buried the gold? You just started counting from an arbitrary place.
1,Marge Simpson,You mean get beaten up by him?
6,Grampa Simpson,He is dead! I'll get a shovel.
0,Homer Simpson,Welcome aboard. It wasn't any easier.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I guess I got caught up in all the glitz and glamour."
0,Homer Simpson,Then the big game between Springfield U. and Springfield A & M. I hate Springfield U. so much.
0,Homer Simpson,"Wherever injustice shows its ugly face, I will be there! For I am the Pie Man!"
3,Bart Simpson,Yo.
0,Homer Simpson,"Allo, you are getting cozy with Sarkozy."
6,Grampa Simpson,We had to move out once we'd filled the head with garbage. The end.
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, stop in and say ""hi"" to me 'cause I'll still be there -- chillin' in my basement bachelor pad."
7,Chief Wiggum,What does it say on my badge?
0,Homer Simpson,"Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, just how I like it: warm and rusty."
3,Bart Simpson,What's Gabbo?
0,Homer Simpson,Is there!
8,Ned Flanders,"Knock that off, you two. It's time for church!"
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm planing down that door that always sticks. I put training wheels on Bart's bike, and made an appointment with the dermatologist to see about my slowly-receding hairline."
0,Homer Simpson,Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
0,Homer Simpson,Ow! Hey! No! No! Ow! N-No! Ow!
0,Homer Simpson,"Kids, I've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. Sir, I need this train!"
0,Homer Simpson,"It's hard to believe there's a place worse than America, but we found it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I can't take it anymore. All right, I'll only be gone for a second."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Gee, your station has a lot of problems."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the lights now."
0,Homer Simpson,"Everybody, look at the much-needed rain. Thank you, God. Now turn the rainwater into wine."
10,Krusty the Clown,Also better get back on those anti-psychotic meds.
0,Homer Simpson,Ed Sullivan.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Herman, a very special lady is having a birthday tomorrow."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Bart Simpson, report to the Principal's Office immediately!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, check this out!"
0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! I win the bet! Who's your Daddy?
3,Bart Simpson,"Sorry kid, but there comes a day when that just doesn't do anything anymore."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, we're all gonna be murdered some day."
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, it's great to have you back, but you walked right into my shot."
5,Lisa Simpson,A-lo-ha!
3,Bart Simpson,What about Coach Fortner?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Get your own!!
5,Lisa Simpson,The bus!
0,Homer Simpson,"I told you, my memory is fuzzy. Fuzzy!"
9,Moe Szyslak,She told me she was washin' her hair tonight. I'm so desperately lonely.
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah. And to make things even more suspenseful... our plane leaves in a half hour!
0,Homer Simpson,Let go! I gotta get to the tank!
5,Lisa Simpson,"No need to thank me, boys."
0,Homer Simpson,But scaring kids is good for them. It hardens them against future terrors -- like roofing and driveway scams.
3,Bart Simpson,Da-ad! Lisa's my little sister!
5,Lisa Simpson,Chief Wig-gum... Don't eat... the clues.
11,Seymour Skinner,I'll be right there! Just saying goodbye to mother! Seymour! I'm going out for a walk! See you in several months at the soonest!
0,Homer Simpson,"That'll do, brick, that'll do."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Now, I can't have toothpaste tonight."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, my eyes are burning!"
3,Bart Simpson,Look at me! /
6,Grampa Simpson,I'll be back in a jiffy.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I didn't see anything to get my hopes up, if that's what you mean."
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! Homer! Put a record on!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm Lisa, and this is Nelson."
11,Seymour Skinner,"You're mine, Simpson."
6,Grampa Simpson,"I'll be deep in the cold, cold ground before I recognize Missoura."
0,Homer Simpson,After pie.
7,Chief Wiggum,I don't follow.
0,Homer Simpson,Are you coming on to me?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, you've been in my room for about four hours now."
1,Marge Simpson,Homer!!
0,Homer Simpson,And tell me I'm not fat.
5,Lisa Simpson,Why are there so many burnt-out ones?
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe, this is Astrid, my ""dealer."" And these are my fans, Gunter, Kyoto, and Cecil Hampstead-on-Cecil-Cecil."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm sorry, Dad. I just find that very cute."
3,Bart Simpson,There's just not enough time to hear 'em all...
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, it's just like my dream."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm just trying to party with you guys.
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm afraid I can't allow that.
0,Homer Simpson,Here's your future!
0,Homer Simpson,Bart! That car belonged to Bonnie and Clyde! Show a little respect.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Settle down there, boy."
3,Bart Simpson,I'm more striking than lovely.
9,Moe Szyslak,"We-we-we switch clothes with them, leave 'em in the bar. Then we pour some brandy around. Like so..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I won't be lonely for long...."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well I better go."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, we are not boarding that plane unless you waive that tax. Waive it..."
0,Homer Simpson,I am so sorry about what happened. But at least you saw what it was like to be married to me for a little while.
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the most horrible truth of all is the plant where I work poisons our water and our air."
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, the courts might not work anymore, but as long as everybody is videotaping everyone else, justice will be done."
1,Marge Simpson,"When you're old, your tattoos will be saggy and illegible!"
0,Homer Simpson,And you can live with that.
3,Bart Simpson,Mr. Hutz when I grow up I want to be a lawyer just like you.
0,Homer Simpson,Don't tell me what I'm not doing.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,YOU MAKE ME FEEL AS YOUNG / AS THE BLOOD I GET FROM SHEEP.
5,Lisa Simpson,Hugh didn't have a bachelor party.
0,Homer Simpson,"It's been another eight years, and what do I have? Same job, same house, same dirty joke book..."
0,Homer Simpson,Pigabar? What the hell is pigabar?
5,Lisa Simpson,What? Nunchuks? Those aren't even Australian.
5,Lisa Simpson,I'd better tell Dad.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I don't care what Mom said. I think you should use this money to take her on a nice vacation."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Forget it, Dad. If I ever become famous, I want it to be for something worthwhile, not because of some obnoxious fad."
1,Marge Simpson,Cut it out! You're upsetting the gravy boat!
1,Marge Simpson,It's all yours.
3,Bart Simpson,So immature.
5,Lisa Simpson,Itchy and Scratchy seem to have lost their edge.
5,Lisa Simpson,My family's here!
5,Lisa Simpson,It's so impressive.
0,Homer Simpson,Wait a minute... that guy on the poster looks familiar.
1,Marge Simpson,...but still no sign of Lurleen's dad!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Bart, why are you hanging around with Nelson so much? He's a bully."
9,Moe Szyslak,"I-I-I yelled out, ""Has anybody seen Mike Rotch?"""
7,Chief Wiggum,But it was...
9,Moe Szyslak,"Is that uh, ""get out"" like leave, or ""get out"" as in: ""Get out. You banged Bridget Fonda?"""
0,Homer Simpson,Hell yeah!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, I've got too much to do to take a nap right now. Lisa, get Maggie out of that cage. And Homer, since you're dressed for it, I got some S & M for ya: Scrubbing and Mopping."

0,Homer Simpson,You've just won 10 million dollars from that Publisher's Cleary-dealie!
7,Chief Wiggum,"And, uh, don't forget Bart Simpson. He's a witness too. Right, Barty?"

0,Homer Simpson,And why am I here?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, at Sunday School we learned that stealing is a sin."

0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, what's that?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Happy anniversary, Sweetie."
8,Ned Flanders,Here comes that vomit again.
5,Lisa Simpson,They had to feed you through a tube.
0,Homer Simpson,And it was gooood.
0,Homer Simpson,"You don't know anything about hydraulic fracturing! You've just been brainwashed by liberal TV shows who use ""fracking"" as an easy bad guy. But it can save this country!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Okay, Edna."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Uh... let's think about this. Martin's gone, but it was an accident. Ruining our lives won't bring him back."
1,Marge Simpson,"All right, already! Everyone knows the man accomplished a lot. Maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about Thomas Edison!"
1,Marge Simpson,No it's not.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hear that, Ralphie? The mayor knows daddy!"
0,Homer Simpson,It's him!
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, please. Don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Very good. Now then, regarding your punishment... do you feel that you've learned your lesson?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Well then, none."
0,Homer Simpson,Ah. Say no more.
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, we're sending you to bed without your supper."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Okay, but can I just finish the smarty-pants answer?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank God there's a fire. Marge's birthday's comin' up."
1,Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, well, you've cooled down."
3,Bart Simpson,Not for long -- I'm saying goodbye to Scammer and Z-Dog. I've learned that even made-up corporate shills can lie to you.
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, Homer. If you think I can."
3,Bart Simpson,You guys should relax. You'll live longer.
0,Homer Simpson,Just take one bite. If you're not one hundred per cent different...
0,Homer Simpson,Pile it on! I want him to be Korean by the time he's done.
0,Homer Simpson,"My dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. I was so close to being a rock star, but now there's a chance it might not happen. I'll just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing."
0,Homer Simpson,I liked when I threw the pudding.
1,Marge Simpson,Dust!!!
3,Bart Simpson,"Thanks Dad, that's great advice."
3,Bart Simpson,"Great. Before anything else, let me just get closer to the door and say ""how crazy are you""?"
9,Moe Szyslak,We have a winner!
5,Lisa Simpson,No. Not really.
5,Lisa Simpson,"All right. Almost done, my little friend. Soon you'll be a nice, cool... RAT?!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's ridiculous."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, that loser Milhouse has always had a thing for her. Don't you love it when nerds don't know they're nerds?"
1,Marge Simpson,Why should I feel like a traffic cop every Sunday morning when I'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us."
1,Marge Simpson,Darn it! I keep pouring juice for five.
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooh, Carl."
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class."
6,Grampa Simpson,"One trick is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere... Like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time... now to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them. ""Give me five bees for a quarter"" you'd say. Now, where were we? Oh yes, the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions, because of the war..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Stupidity, eh?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, Mr. Flanders is really into the Beatles."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Step right up, only two bits!"
5,Lisa Simpson,LISA SIMPSON / LISA SIMPSON...
9,Moe Szyslak,"I bet I win a locker full of treasure, like a solid gold bar of silver or Picasso's TV!"
1,Marge Simpson,We never will.
0,Homer Simpson,"Sure did. I'd do anything for you, honey. Especially if it's easy."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, what are these holes?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, kids. These wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Ralph, I like that name."
0,Homer Simpson,Nooooooooooooooooo!
5,Lisa Simpson,He bought new shoelaces. With fancy metal tips!
0,Homer Simpson,Blech! Eww! Geesh! I'll take a crab juice.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Then this is just me!
3,Bart Simpson,Can I tag along?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Safe... safe... razor blade... syringe... ooh, white chocolate!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey man, you planted that!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's problems on your one little speech. If anything turned him bad, it's that time you let him wear a bathing suit instead of underwear. And let's not forget your little speech..."
0,Homer Simpson,Don't buy it! I bought one last year and it was crap construction!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Who wants a kiss? Who wants a kiss?
0,Homer Simpson,"That freeloading fatso! Marge, could you cut back on your makeup budget?"
11,Seymour Skinner,Hmm. I knew this day would come.
0,Homer Simpson,Open a window.
0,Homer Simpson,Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Find out in whose loving memory this week's service is. The answer may shock you.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man. You can treat me like dirt and I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don't like it... I can change!!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,It means masculine teacher.
3,Bart Simpson,What? I'm not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh, what a lousy hand. I'll stand."
1,Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, but that's Michelangelo's David. It's a masterpiece!"
0,Homer Simpson,Can you?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, where did you get that?"
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm so proud of you, Homer. You got us our house back."
3,Bart Simpson,"More ""stink lines"" boys."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yes I am! Come on, Spotty!"
9,Moe Szyslak,Hey you can't come in here dressed like that.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Nelson, you're not really angry at me. You're full of rage 'cause your father abandoned you."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Wow, you've signed up quite a few people, Dad: Sea Captain, Bumblebee Man, Comic Book Guy, the Squeaky Voiced Teen..."
9,Moe Szyslak,Go grab all his money and vodka and gin. And I'll knit a nice thnord from his leathery skin.
3,Bart Simpson,"Oooh - wise guy, eh?"
0,Homer Simpson,You-- get-- out!
3,Bart Simpson,"I've got to grow an inch by tomorrow or I won't get that part. Pull, you mighty stallions, pull. Show me no mercy."
0,Homer Simpson,I sawed you on the television.
9,Moe Szyslak,You from outta town?
0,Homer Simpson,Okay...
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, thank you, everyone. But -- 10% of your applause should go to my little partner, Lisa Simpson. For if it were not for her infectious moralizing, we would not be here today to witness the unveiling of... The Li'l Lisa Recycling Plant!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Can't tie up the line, Grampa."
3,Bart Simpson,"Rich kids don't need school! When I grow up, you can buy an apartment building and make me the super."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, here we go..."
5,Lisa Simpson,No! Connect!
0,Homer Simpson,"You mean, like, medical testing?"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Well, why the hell am I down here?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Yes!!! Willie, I've got a girlfriend!"
3,Bart Simpson,Just testing.
5,Lisa Simpson,That isn't a word.
8,Ned Flanders,"But, but..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Atta girl. I love you, sweet --"
5,Lisa Simpson,Ow! Son of a...
3,Bart Simpson,We need you!
1,Marge Simpson,It's not giant and it's not in the distance! It's small and it's in our room!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Oh hey, is that a Penn State banner? My cousin went there."
0,Homer Simpson,Stop eating our future!
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, - he's pretty chunkified, all right."
6,Grampa Simpson,Beh?
0,Homer Simpson,"It's all in the Bible, son! It's the Prankster's Bible!"
8,Ned Flanders,But it could be my mother! Howdi...
7,Chief Wiggum,That's where we found your daughter's things.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, grow up."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yes, because only by knowing them can you prevent bad little kids from saying them."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I feel a buzz, but I don't feel happier. It's not like when I was drinking with Homer."
3,Bart Simpson,"So, I suppose that's a hillbilly Jacuzzi?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm opposed to the whole thing! Damn opposed!"
5,Lisa Simpson,It's so great that Michael's doing what he loves.
3,Bart Simpson,Why did a vision of my future include a story about Homer and Lincoln's gold?
0,Homer Simpson,What? It's not Magaggie's birthday? Oh.
8,Ned Flanders,"Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. And it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Spare some salt, tubby?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Uh, say, ""Jesus,"" what was the name of the son of Zachariah?"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Hey, they're playing the elephant song."
0,Homer Simpson,A-ha!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,An information desk!
3,Bart Simpson,"One, two, three."
8,Ned Flanders,"Isn't this great, Marge? We're like Jiminy Cricket for the whole ding-dang town. A half-man, half-bug that knows what's best for everybody. Um-hm."
0,Homer Simpson,They're gonna blow it up!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Get ya hands off me. Get off! I don't need your stinkin' show, anyway. With a mug like this, I can get on any soap in Springfield."
0,Homer Simpson,"Take that, you greedy fat cats. Marge, gimme your purse."
1,Marge Simpson,How fast are they going?
1,Marge Simpson,"Now you listen here, Bub. We paid you all the savings we had in the world. You could at least tell my husband something encouraging."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, now the whole town can benefit from their nutrients!"
0,Homer Simpson,But this is the best I could do. I guess I'm no better at being Thomas Edison than I was at being Homer Simpson.
5,Lisa Simpson,Dad?...
0,Homer Simpson,Let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.
3,Bart Simpson,"Jenny, I can't take the pressure anymore. I have to come clean. I'm only pretending to be good..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ohh, how are you feeling, sweetie?"
0,Homer Simpson,"See that ball of fire? That's the sun. It goes by many names: Apollo's Lantern, Day-moon, Old Blazey. The important thing is never to touch it."
8,Ned Flanders,"Whoa, slow down. I never go to ""second entendre"" on the first date."
0,Homer Simpson,"ALL RIGHT MARGE, YOU'VE CONVINCED ME, THERE ARE MORE TERRIBLE THINGS / THAN MUSICAL COMEDIES WHERE EVERYONE SINGS."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I get a whiff of the immigrant from these newfangled superheroes.
1,Marge Simpson,I got all the way out to the tree before I realized I'd left the house.
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, son. I'm sure he's up in Heaven right now, laughing it up with all the other celebrities -- John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Joseph Stalin... I wish I were dead."
10,Krusty the Clown,"I can't watch movies on a screen this small. And the music today -- don't get me started. I said, don't get me started!!"
0,Homer Simpson,How do you figure?
0,Homer Simpson,"Like most of my problems, it all started at Moe's..."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Because I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped for me."
3,Bart Simpson,Martin!
3,Bart Simpson,You don't have to worship him. He's not a God.
1,Marge Simpson,"We need the money, and my life is pretty boring. Last week some Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn't let them leave. They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade."
3,Bart Simpson,You're gonna eat a blizzard of...
9,Moe Szyslak,"Lighten up, Homer. You're making Happy Hour bitterly ironic."
0,Homer Simpson,Who are you! I'll get you!
0,Homer Simpson,A man in an apron!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I'm not sure God responds to threats and intimidation."
3,Bart Simpson,Worked like a charm.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Assistant Groundskeeper Skinner, don't you think it's wrong that I can't get the best math education because I'm a girl?"
5,Lisa Simpson,He's really having trouble keeping his balance.
0,Homer Simpson,"I couldn't sleep, because I thought there might be a sign of my Mom in one of these articles. They never did find her body."
5,Lisa Simpson,Proceed to the page with the butterfly bookmark as I cuddle up with Madame Bunny.
8,Ned Flanders,"My friend, you have a deal-arooney!"
1,Marge Simpson,Four thousand dollars?!
5,Lisa Simpson,Maybe there's something in Dad's backpack.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well then, I guess the moral is, ""No good deed goes unrewarded."""
1,Marge Simpson,I'm not getting back in this car until you drive like a sane person.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Man alive, what a stinko thousand years! Blimp wrecks, teen-agers... then again, we had two TV shows with Andy Griffith."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Otto's got a girlfriend! Otto's got a girlfriend!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Finally Smithers, a device worthy of storing my top-secret enemies list."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thank you for arranging this, Dr. Hibbert."

6,Grampa Simpson,Aw... it's beautiful.
5,Lisa Simpson,It's so sad that Krusty is ashamed of his roots.
3,Bart Simpson,"Fox had an endless supply of clever slogans, man."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a better place."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Flanders. But when you get in, you can use my audio tour. Narrated by Melanie Griffith."
0,Homer Simpson,Here you go -- beer-battered shrimp.
1,Marge Simpson,"I used to be a little overwhelmed, too, but it's not that hard. I can show you."
0,Homer Simpson,But what if the weathergirl--
0,Homer Simpson,"Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy."
3,Bart Simpson,"C'mon, man, leave me alone."
8,Ned Flanders,Better not take a full dose.
0,Homer Simpson,Must you do this every time?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, if we're going to bet, why don't we make it interesting?"
1,Marge Simpson,"You didn't join a band to become famous like in ""Almost Famous."" You loved playing music with your friends. That was enough to make you happy."
9,Moe Szyslak,What's the matter? I'm making as nice as I can.
0,Homer Simpson,Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, I was just thinking what a good parking job I did with it."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh it is.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, what's the deal, loser?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Are you mad, woman? You never know when an old calendar might come in handy. Sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? And these TV Guides... so many memories."
0,Homer Simpson,"I think you're right, dumplin'."
5,Lisa Simpson,Huh. It's a pigeon.

2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well hello, Marge. Lovely day for tennis, eh?"
0,Homer Simpson,"No, faith is what you have in things that don't exist. Your awesomeness is real."
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes. You've shortened your life significantly, so someone else can have a slight extension of theirs."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, yeah, well you and I could write a better cartoon than that."
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, before you blame the dog, I think you should take a look at these surveillance photos."
3,Bart Simpson,"Look, man. I have to keep my dark past hidden. There's someone new in my life now."
7,Chief Wiggum,Aren't I?
7,Chief Wiggum,I can't believe he's paying us a thousand bucks to pretend it's the seventies.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, but last year I took Barney dressed as Marge. Think how much better they'll think you look."
3,Bart Simpson,"A lot of people blow, but no one blows like you."
8,Ned Flanders,"You know, maybe I should use a towel marked ""B.D.D."" -- big diddily deal!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, if you had cleaned up your room when I asked you to, your father's trick back would still be aligned. So you pick up this mess right now."
1,Marge Simpson,That's it. From now on I'm growing all our vegetables myself.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have."
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, yes, yes. That's fine. Good, good."
9,Moe Szyslak,To the scooter store!
0,Homer Simpson,"""Neighbors forever. Oh, no! Ned Flanders."""

5,Lisa Simpson,I didn't cushion your...
0,Homer Simpson,"No wonder they call it ""the good book."""
0,Homer Simpson,"And I'm sixty-nine, because people always laugh when you say sixty-nine. No one knows why."
5,Lisa Simpson,Ohhhh. / Hiiiii.
8,Ned Flanders,"Okay, kids, now I'm gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. But this should only be used in a life or death situation."
10,Krusty the Clown,Matrix Poochie!
1,Marge Simpson,"We need Bart to help fold your father's underpants. Where is he, anyway?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Fine, fine! Homer! Give him a party!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"""Id. Along with the ego and the superego, one of three components of the psyche."""
0,Homer Simpson,"It's not for me to judge, Ned because... I am the better man!"

3,Bart Simpson,You ate meat! You ate meat!
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay Lisa, I'm turning my phone back on to see if your father is ready to be picked up. Huh, I have over four hundred text messages."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Yep, everything's nice and legal."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I brought my lucky rabbit's foot. I can have good luck without it.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers! That precision assault popped it back into place! Thank you masked stranger!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, Bart. You're supposed to be developing verbal abilities for your big aptitude test tomorrow."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, where are you going?"
10,Krusty the Clown,Here's my address book. Go get those stars!

3,Bart Simpson,I've kissed three girls.
1,Marge Simpson,Hostess Twinkies?
1,Marge Simpson,"The best part is, I don't have to ask your father where he was all night, because I was there!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Why do you have to be such a pain all the time? Don't you realize you're getting a bad reputation?
1,Marge Simpson,"I've got to tell Homer about this baby in just the right way and at just the right time. Until then please, keep this to yourselves."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, it says here your name is ""L.T. Smash."""
0,Homer Simpson,"So it's opposite land. Crooks chase cops, cats have puppies..."
0,Homer Simpson,"But I can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. Oh, why did I drink all that crab juice?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,You're demoted.
1,Marge Simpson,My name is Marge Simpson and I have an idea. It may sound a little boring at first...
10,Krusty the Clown,I'll perform at your birthday party! Sober!
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, look at me! We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours, I'll be dead. I can't afford to lose your trust again."

1,Marge Simpson,Why did I do this for money? Why did I do this for money?
0,Homer Simpson,"Remember Springfield, keep on swinging!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, that's right Barney. This year I invested in pumpkins. They've been going up the whole month of October, and I got a feeling they're gonna peak right around January. And bang, that's when I'll cash in."

0,Homer Simpson,"Whatcha watchin', honey?"

2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Silence, you sadistic monster! I've got my memory back, and I'm going to wreak a terrible vengeance. Taking an idea I got from a Stephen King book, I'm going to cover this town with a dome!"
0,Homer Simpson,The abandoned warehouse!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Eh, this might take awhile, kid. Why don't you and your buddy run along?"

5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?"
0,Homer Simpson,Wha -- Wait! I'm no missionary! I don't even believe in Jebus! Let me out!
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, you're not gonna ask me to pose nude, are ya?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Hey, hot stuff. I've got a competition tomorrow. I could use a good-luck snuggle."
3,Bart Simpson,Name one more.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, this is terrible!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Man, these old cameras are really built solid."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Uh... I have a question, Mr. Jenkins. Could you tell us about all the hard work and buckling down that you put into every cartoon?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Ow! Ooh! Ay-eee!
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah. Yeah!
9,Moe Szyslak,"You ever scrub your hands real fast, and think you're seein' a third one? One time I looked down and there really was. I gotta get a new lock for that bathroom."
0,Homer Simpson,"There it is. ""Aust-rali-a."" I'll be damned..."
3,Bart Simpson,"I don't know who that is, but I'm convinced. Let's start cutting."
1,Marge Simpson,Stop the wedding!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, there's gotta be something on this thing for that thing."
1,Marge Simpson,LOVE LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, sorry, I'm not in that business anymore."
3,Bart Simpson,I'm looking at one right now.
3,Bart Simpson,Don't talk. Listen. The social order of elementary school is densely layered. The coolest kids are at the top.
1,Marge Simpson,Oh really?
1,Marge Simpson,Here comes the flying saucer!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Stop this ribbon cutting! This is private property!
3,Bart Simpson,"Ma, could you get me some milk?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Flanders, I can't listen to your crap before my coffee."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, three times. The last one was nominated for a Peabody, whatever that is."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Take my wallet and leave me alone!
1,Marge Simpson,"Look, just because everyone who lived in that house was hacked to bits, doesn't mean the Flanders will be."
0,Homer Simpson,You know who would really like this place? Bart. Wait a minute... where the hell is Bart?
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, you can fix little defects like that with gentle nagging. Make it part of the background noise of your relationship. That's how I polished Homer into the perfect... Homer! No, that's ice!"
0,Homer Simpson,To Marge. And all the blissful years I've spent hiding from her in this bar.
0,Homer Simpson,You'd better.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, yes, I am shopping for Maggie, our baby together, so this looks perfectly innocent."
0,Homer Simpson,Your old meat made me sick!
1,Marge Simpson,Look! The Crosstown Bridge!
3,Bart Simpson,Kill me.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Look, the thing is, it's more important to know how to take a test than knowing what's on it. So, do the ones you know first. If you don't know one, guess B and move on. Now, what is the capital of Massachusetts?"
0,Homer Simpson,'Preciate it.
5,Lisa Simpson,I'VE BEEN TO PARIS / AND LONDON AND TOKYO TOWN / BUT ONE CRAZY BURG / HAS 'EM ALL BEAT HANDS DOWN...
0,Homer Simpson,What's the point of putting my socks on? I just have to take them off again a week later.
9,Moe Szyslak,That's really stuck there good.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, we both faced a tough decision...go off to journalism school, or stay in Springfield with our sweethearts?"
5,Lisa Simpson,That's funny. I don't feel stupid.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,There's soda on the plane!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, good. He needs his sleep."
0,Homer Simpson,Why do you keep talking that way?!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Now, because I am too kind, I will give you all a five-minute head start. You may commence running."
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, what are you getting at?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Sorry, Dad. I can't just magically cure a broken leg."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Now until Miss Hoover returns, this class will be getting a permanent substitute."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, Captain Janeway! Your mission ended too soon! Too soon..."
0,Homer Simpson,That my family isn't the center of my universe? Are you nuts?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, I think it's an eviction notice. We're gonna be homeless, like Lucille Ball in ""The Stone Pillow""!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey Mom, how's the leg?..."
3,Bart Simpson,"Good, let's get to work. Me and Nelson will build the treehouse. Martin, draw up plans for a coconut radio and, if possible, a coconut Nintendo system."
8,Ned Flanders,Where in the Bible?
1,Marge Simpson,You see? A little persistence and patience paid off. That'll be 300 dollars.
3,Bart Simpson,"Kwyjibo: Uh, a big, dumb, balding..."
5,Lisa Simpson,This one whistled at me!
3,Bart Simpson,I am so gonna try out for that!
0,Homer Simpson,Hmm. Probably a reminder to relax more.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, you seem sweet, but I could never have a favorite."
7,Chief Wiggum,"These kids are gettin' a little out of hand, Kent, so we're gonna have to fire the time-out gas."
0,Homer Simpson,I got Marge!
5,Lisa Simpson,Where'd you get that shirt?
3,Bart Simpson,"Front and back, sir."
3,Bart Simpson,Tire fire.
1,Marge Simpson,YOU LIKE POTATO... YOU LIKE TOMATO...
0,Homer Simpson,Sh-sh-sh.
3,Bart Simpson,Everybody come quick! They're hatching!
11,Seymour Skinner,"How about you, Bart? Let me guess, you forgot to bring something."
5,Lisa Simpson,Dear Log: My worst fears have been confirmed. I've hit my mental and creative peak at the tender age of eight. What will my life be like after I descend into mediocrity?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, the beer's gone. I'll have to suck it out of the shag."
5,Lisa Simpson,Both of us heard mysterious noises coming from this very spot.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Bart, stop creating a diversion and get out of here!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I had but one item left on the list... ""A picture of myself with a smiling child."" What could be easier?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"I gotta sit up now? What am I, Baryshnikov?"
0,Homer Simpson,So lazy.
10,Krusty the Clown,"A religious clown thing, yes."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh. My. God. He's telling the truth. I have to take you to our civic leaders.
1,Marge Simpson,I'm not insane!
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in."
5,Lisa Simpson,I don't want you to go!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ooh, here's the tape I need."
1,Marge Simpson,"Play along! Ooh, this couldn't feel more natural. Glug, glug, glug. That's a good little mammal."
3,Bart Simpson,"No, on the street."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, what could be more fun than today's trip to the liquor store. Thanks for the beef jerky."
5,Lisa Simpson,"This place is great! If I cover my peripheral vision, I feel like I'm in France!"
3,Bart Simpson,Great Caesar's Ghost! A talking Krusty doll!
0,Homer Simpson,Marge! Are you running off with Moe?!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh, please. What don't they learn? Don't trust mice... Cats are made of glass..."
7,Chief Wiggum,Cecil? I think not. This looks like the work of crazy old Sideshow Bob.
0,Homer Simpson,"Dasher, Dancer..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, Maggie! It's Sgt. Thug's Mountaintop Command Post, complete with Death-bringer missiles that really launch!"
6,Grampa Simpson,You can be the Crimson Cockaboy. Hmmm?
5,Lisa Simpson,"""Photo op helping Kindergartners take off snow boots..."" ""Move the brushfire hazard needle..."" Um, shouldn't I stay here and work on school policy?"
1,Marge Simpson,This is the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my entire life!
5,Lisa Simpson,"While you're singing and dancing, somewhere out there Ronaldo is waiting to be found."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, as long as it's quiet."
1,Marge Simpson,"Really? Look at you... so grown up... well, I've moved on too..."
11,Seymour Skinner,What if I see her hand at the same time you see her face?
3,Bart Simpson,"Right on, Doc. Another successful diagnosis."
0,Homer Simpson,"Dohhh! Sauce, cheese, topping!"
1,Marge Simpson,But this will be so confusing. The mailman won't know what to do. Did you think of the mailman at all before you did this?
1,Marge Simpson,It was a little hard on me having him around the house
0,Homer Simpson,Pfft! Knew it.
1,Marge Simpson,Oooh. Recipe-related bumper cars.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Cut it out, Bart!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Must... turn... over. Got to... greet... dignitaries!
0,Homer Simpson,You've been living like a king on my dollar... Super unleaded gas... Silver bullets?
6,Grampa Simpson,"I knew that Bongo would have a good home there, and Burns would never find him."
5,Lisa Simpson,"It's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs! Oh, and you, Dad. Heh heh..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, I'll find a way to get you out of this wedding. In the meantime, just say yes, so Lou will be safe -- look how happy he is."
0,Homer Simpson,"What are you talking about, Professor Frink? They're clearly in the ""On"" position. See? ""On."""
1,Marge Simpson,I'm going to find my husband. But don't depress the kids.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh no, I ripped it."
0,Homer Simpson,It's closing?! But where will people find clips of old TV shows if they're not housed in a giant building? Where? Where?
0,Homer Simpson,I make my own turnoffs.
0,Homer Simpson,I've made my choice.
11,Seymour Skinner,Excuse me. I'm supposed to stand in your store window and breastfeed Bilbo Baggins.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, actually -"
0,Homer Simpson,"Sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Mother, she's right here."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, everybody! If you look real close, you can kinda make 'em out."
8,Ned Flanders,"Ooh, thanks for dropping by!"
3,Bart Simpson,STOP IT! / STOP IT! / DAD!
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, I defy anyone to tell the difference between these donuts and ones baked today. Hey, my boy's s'posed to be here any second on a field trip. They been through here yet?"
1,Marge Simpson,Thank God it's just like her busy box.
0,Homer Simpson,"Huh? Oh, right. Can you hold it?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Welcome to the family, Snowball III!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, maybe you better take Milhouse home."
5,Lisa Simpson,I live in a house.
0,Homer Simpson,You saved my life. And I came here every day to make sure you pulled through.
0,Homer Simpson,Nooo! Not community service -- I can't stand helping others! I just can't!
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, I really don't appreciate being called a narc."
0,Homer Simpson,"No one's calling it an angel, Lisa. If you'll look carefully, you'll notice I never once used the word ""angel""."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Spade, why did you put Farley in charge of the bees? Hey buddy, down in front."
7,Chief Wiggum,Eat Fix-A-Flat!
5,Lisa Simpson,I'll be cool.
0,Homer Simpson,"I was afraid you'd cancel our date so I stayed away from you completely, even though it meant skipping school for three weeks and graduating this summer... I hope."
3,Bart Simpson,Uh... I don't think this is the kind of coat that opens.
0,Homer Simpson,Have you ever wondered what I do in that locked room?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I knew that before I came in here. A guy outside told me that."
0,Homer Simpson,Outside? That's a one-hour parking zone -- and you've been here a good eighty-one minutes.
0,Homer Simpson,I'd sell my first-born son.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,A poor man.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, you want Homer. I'm sorry, I thought you meant Himmler. Heinrich Himmler. You know, the guy who invented the Heimlich manure?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, you voted for the right movie. I'm glad you were on the jury."
11,Seymour Skinner,Shut up! Shut up! This is a spoiler-free zone!
0,Homer Simpson,Vanderbilt?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I've got the answer. Just let me run this church like a business.
3,Bart Simpson,Will this Christmas never end?
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, we don't need to stop here."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, a letter from Ovenfresh Industries!"
0,Homer Simpson,"I admit it. I did screw up, but I won't feel guilty until I can put a human face on this."
3,Bart Simpson,Sucker.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh Roger, would you hand me the suntan oil?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, the TV's screwed up. It only plays ""Married... With Children."""
0,Homer Simpson,I think I have to do it again. My blindfold came off.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Everyone knows you're faking it, Bart."
0,Homer Simpson,Can one of the hundred be making the list?
5,Lisa Simpson,Because you love the taste of my imaginary tea.
1,Marge Simpson,"I don't know if you watch us all the time, or if we're just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf, and every once in a while you check out what kind of crazy tunnels we've built."
0,Homer Simpson,You made that TV show really mad.
0,Homer Simpson,"I hate shopping. I'm bored, my feet hurt, I'm too big for the choo-choo train... hmm, where's the ""husband chair?"""
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, son! Give him the glue!"
0,Homer Simpson,A boy who gets some on the side.
3,Bart Simpson,"Sure thing, Such."
0,Homer Simpson,I hear you loud and clear.
5,Lisa Simpson,Action! I've got to talk to that woman who invented Malibu Stacy and see if I can get her to --
1,Marge Simpson,"Good sir, I do not approve of your fleshly gaze."
0,Homer Simpson,Carl?
1,Marge Simpson,I still think you should have left that at the motel.
0,Homer Simpson,You seem cool. Wanna catch a movie?
0,Homer Simpson,Oh no. Wait... maybe I didn't do it right.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"You got that right. Remember the time he ate my goldfish and you lied to me and said I never had any goldfish? But why'd I have the bowl, Bart? Why did I have the bowl?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yep. Man one, machine zero. How do you like that score?"
10,Krusty the Clown,You just keep right on drivin'.
1,Marge Simpson,But... all I did was tell the truth.
3,Bart Simpson,Climb aboard.
0,Homer Simpson,Won't.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Mr. Simpson, I know you're not one of our wealthier parents, but surely you'll honor your son's enormous debt."
3,Bart Simpson,Why don't you let us watch TV and get her a Roofi CD?
3,Bart Simpson,"You okay, Milhouse?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, I'm glad you had fun, but I wouldn't get too into that Catholic church. With all the sitting and standing and kneeling, it's like Simon Says without a winner!"
0,Homer Simpson,No one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --
3,Bart Simpson,"So? I'll bounce back. I always bounce back -- like after the time I accidentally called the teacher ""Mom""."
8,Ned Flanders,"Heydilly ho, window buddy. Just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oooh, that is gonna hurt tomorrow."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, nice night for a walk."
3,Bart Simpson,"Ah! This is what being a kid is all about. Hey, Huck. What's L-I-N-C-O-N doin' here?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, man! Leave my sister alone!"
0,Homer Simpson,All good.
0,Homer Simpson,You're the nerd.
0,Homer Simpson,"I'd better call it a night, guys. I don't want to take any more of your money."
5,Lisa Simpson,Greta called. It seems you told her you were sick.
1,Marge Simpson,"That ""Mom"" stuff doesn't work on me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow! I've seen photos of this, but you can't really experience it until you're here."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, I think I've figured this thing out. It can go up and down, but not side to side, or back in time."
7,Chief Wiggum,Rounding up your total. That's a fifty dollar fine.
3,Bart Simpson,Like I don't have a soul?
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm here to share my moral outrage, but this time it's not about that giant, inflatable Dos Equis bottle. It's about a certain house in our town..."
0,Homer Simpson,Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers.
3,Bart Simpson,Wait a minute. I thought you said I couldn't have this.
0,Homer Simpson,"You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, wait..."
0,Homer Simpson,But I have finger insurance!
3,Bart Simpson,I'll get back to you.
0,Homer Simpson,Anybody else?
3,Bart Simpson,Get a room!
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, I've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos."
0,Homer Simpson,"""The end will come at sundown."" Heh heh heh heh. Hey, wait a second. I don't like the sound of that."
0,Homer Simpson,Aww. That'll be my screensaver.
0,Homer Simpson,I'd kill you if I had my gun.
5,Lisa Simpson,"But, Dad, it's barbaric! How does killing a deer make you more of a man?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Hello Moe?
3,Bart Simpson,I don't know... Fleecin' old people?
5,Lisa Simpson,A long-lost half-brother. How Dickensian!
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world."
7,Chief Wiggum,Perhaps you are. But I say Bob goes back to jail.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Who should appear but the unrequited love of my college years, Mimsy Bancroft...Of course, by then Mimsy had her share of wrinkles and a gray hair or two, but my adoring eyes saw past those minor imperfections to her 21-year-old daughter, Lily."
1,Marge Simpson,It would be a good excuse to use my Yaqui tea set...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's a kaleidoscope."
1,Marge Simpson,Mm-hm. What about clay? You got any problem with clay?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, hey, I kid! I kid 'cause I love. I tell ya, the best folk in the world are prison folk."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm transferring a call into you, Mr. Burns."
11,Seymour Skinner,Sir?
1,Marge Simpson,Stop the showcase!
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, really, I can't."
0,Homer Simpson,"Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, for the love of Peter! That's all anybody brought. Some damn fool went around telling everyone I love that slimy goop. Well, toss it in the pile over there."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Ah, nothing lifts my spirits like shopping."
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, I'm sorry... but I will not save the rainforest."
3,Bart Simpson,Finish the damn story. I've got a hockey game tonight.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, let's put him to the test. Me love beer."
9,Moe Szyslak,Once they destroy each other...
0,Homer Simpson,Bart! Turn down that original cast recording and go to sleep!
0,Homer Simpson,DAY BY DAY / DAY BY DAY / I'VE GOT THREE KIDS / AND TWO ARE OKAY / TWO ARE OKAY! / ONE OF THEM IS THE BABY / THE SMART ONE IS MINE MAYBE / I HOPE THE BOY GETS RABIES / DAY BY DAY BY DAY / DAY BY DAY... / OH I PRAY / DAY BY DAY BY DAY BY DAAAY!

5,Lisa Simpson,"Okay everyone -- just be yourself. Don't look in the camera, pretend I'm not here, and... no toupees..."
0,Homer Simpson,Cha-ching!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, we need help. Someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm."
0,Homer Simpson,Patterson was right. I'm crashing and burning... crashing and burning...
3,Bart Simpson,I can have all my birthday parties in it!
0,Homer Simpson,Singing is the lowest form of communication.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oooh, the gum with the cracker center. Mmm."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, it's just what I wanted. Here, Marge, this is for you."
5,Lisa Simpson,Yeah man.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Great heavens! It's one of those nude female fire stations. Ohh, I'd always be second place to some kitten stuck in a tree. Let's go, Smithers. Smithers?"
0,Homer Simpson,Ah... another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I'll have the smiley-face breakfast special."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,You have the brain-pan of a stagecoach tilter.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Welcome aboard, son."
5,Lisa Simpson,"There, finished. Now if I win just two more games of online Boggle, I'll be ready to start writing."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, a handsome sum that can end this little embrolio once and for all."
3,Bart Simpson,It was an amusing episode... of our lives.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Hey, who has better vacation ideas than Triple-A? According to the publisher of this Triple-A guidebook, no one."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, well... Fun's over, but I still have my wonderful money."
3,Bart Simpson,Milhouse has one.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,You call this a tax return?!
0,Homer Simpson,It sure has. You see this bulge back here?
1,Marge Simpson,"Is it safe to eat that much food, Dr. Hibbert?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, that's everything I know that girls like."

0,Homer Simpson,Who's this?
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, to absorb some local color through the magic of AM radio."
1,Marge Simpson,You've already used up your birthday and Christmas presents on that peach tree we got you. And you hardly ever play with that anymore.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Marge, Homer, this is Brody and Madison McKenna. Bart has been sharing a desk with their daughter Nikki."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Eh, it doesn't matter. If there's one day a year to give unwed mothers a break, it's Christmas."
1,Marge Simpson,Cue the band.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I'M MISTER BURNS!
8,Ned Flanders,"Try 'er now, Marge."

5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, what she's saying is you've had your moment in the sun and now it's time for you to gracefully step aside."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, it's about time."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'd get out, but I don't know where I am."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, this is your chance to develop a new and better identity. May I suggest ""good-natured doormat?"""
9,Moe Szyslak,"Whoa, check that out! / Stuff is getting' done! / Look at them renovations! / And... finished!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Goodnight, moon."
0,Homer Simpson,"Now remember, no loud noises. Oh man, that breeze feels good!"

0,Homer Simpson,"Aha! I've got it! Brain, how can I ever thank you?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Granted.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Mmm-hmm, it's Mr. Skinner now. I'm just a man. Bart, I want to apologize for the awkward position Edna and I put you in. Your... your help made our love possible. I don't know what we'll do without you. Well, so long."
1,Marge Simpson,No you didn't.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh, he's so charming!"

10,Krusty the Clown,"Me again! So if Dad loved his jokes, then..."
0,Homer Simpson,I don't think anything I've ever done is wrong.
3,Bart Simpson,Maybe you better take that temperature one more time.
0,Homer Simpson,"See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, what are you doing here?"
3,Bart Simpson,What're you talkin' about?
5,Lisa Simpson,Mm! Delicioso!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh please. From what I hear, you waltz in there at 10:30, take a nap on the toilet, then sit around ""Google""-ing your own name until lunch."
3,Bart Simpson,Till death do you part...
0,Homer Simpson,"So, here's to my best friend, Ned."
8,Ned Flanders,You just be ready with that garbage bag.
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe, we want our bar back."

6,Grampa Simpson,What?! The contents of that locker are my private business! Get out!
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, where did you get these donuts?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, okay. This time I'll just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him."
1,Marge Simpson,"And that's the drunk tank, and this is mommy's desk."
5,Lisa Simpson,Why isn't my name in the program?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,So my offer... for one ton of your uranium... is a goat.
1,Marge Simpson,An illegal download? But Hollywood says stealing from Hollywood is wrong.
1,Marge Simpson,I thought you might want to snuggle.
0,Homer Simpson,"Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I don't like this movie. And I'm going to boycott your financier... Mr. Burns."
0,Homer Simpson,Nobody make me any breakfast. A man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.
0,Homer Simpson,CBS.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, I forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer. If someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a fire."
1,Marge Simpson,This isn't the line for a movie. Why are you wearing that costume?
3,Bart Simpson,Enough talk.
7,Chief Wiggum,"I'm gonna go uh, study the menu."
0,Homer Simpson,Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Mister Rodgers drunk.
6,Grampa Simpson,My own grandson thinks I'm a liar.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Lisa, your outburst was either a sign of deep emotional imbalance, or a passionate response to a sobering truth. Luckily, the treatment for both is intensive therapy."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh how do I know this isn't some beautiful dream, too?"
0,Homer Simpson,"No, no. This candidate has to be unbelievably ridiculous."
5,Lisa Simpson,What is so funny? They're destroying the world!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thanks. But I couldn't have done it, Mom. I mean, the person you kiss under a mulberry tree is someone you'll love for the rest of your life."
1,Marge Simpson,Spiro's...
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ball pit, that's nice. One, two, three colors -- you got 'em all."
3,Bart Simpson,"I liked it when it was me, Mom and Homer. You wrecked everything. I'm leaving. Goodbye."
9,Moe Szyslak,"It's hopeless, ain't it?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge. But this gun had a hold on me. I felt this incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun. So please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I guess Dad just takes us for granted.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Another barrier broken. Right on, sister!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,BECAUSE...
11,Seymour Skinner,"All right, first academic alert: Wiggum, Ralph..."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Will they ever?
0,Homer Simpson,Of course!
3,Bart Simpson,You mean you killed Ned Flanders.
0,Homer Simpson,Not Mr. Blasty?
0,Homer Simpson,All the time. It was the title of our second album!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Good Lord, I may lose Edna forever. I've gotta stop her from winning. Then she'll be broken, miserable and mine."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Stopping Mr. Burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on ""Beezus and Ramona."" But I know someone who can help..."
11,Seymour Skinner,Stop laughing! It will scar him for life!
0,Homer Simpson,Get back here so we can put our love on a shirt!
9,Moe Szyslak,"So they really based that Homer Simpson character on you, huh?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Really? That's not what Reverend Lovejoy's been tellin' me. Wow, you're good. Thanks!"
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll have you know, I wrote it down."
11,Seymour Skinner,I said stand down!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey Flanders, over here. I got us some kick-ass seats."
1,Marge Simpson,Yes! Yes!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Aw jeez, there's somethin' in my eye. Ah, it's just glass."
11,Seymour Skinner,That was one lousy career day.
0,Homer Simpson,Put that sissy down!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but there's no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, I'm grabbing my skateboard and headin' for that gorge."
0,Homer Simpson,I mean I will win you back.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Chill Thunder! ""Chill Thunder""!"
1,Marge Simpson,Hello? Homer? Where are you? You promised you were going to have a tea party with Maggie.
0,Homer Simpson,"Now kids, while your mother's gone, I don't wanna have to wash any dishes. So, from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton, and we'll eat while standing over the sink or toilet."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank God for the big jar."
0,Homer Simpson,Excellent guitar riff.
9,Moe Szyslak,"I BELIEVE IN YOUSE... you guys, you saved me! You do care!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh... Mr. Burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, I'm no lover-boy."
1,Marge Simpson,"What is it, honey?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"It's not like you made me say ""penis""!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Simpson, we're gonna put you away for a long, long time."
5,Lisa Simpson,"A little tired of revenge, are we?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I hate that fish!
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, this is Italy -- look, the town drunk is two years old."
3,Bart Simpson,Wait a minute! You did it!
0,Homer Simpson,"Here, guys."
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow Mom, your guns got us a great table -- right by the lobster tank."
3,Bart Simpson,"No problemo. Hey, Moe! Look over there."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Actually, you made one. What Shakespeare really said was ""'twere well it were done quickly."""
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Take me, a barren old thistle, and spare this sweet young flower!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Tell me again why we're spending our vacation on ""The Island of Lost Souls""?"
1,Marge Simpson,"What? No! Listen, Charles, I don't want to hurt your feelings..."
3,Bart Simpson,About the frisbee.
6,Grampa Simpson,"You, president? This is the greatest country in the world. We got a whole system set up to keep people like you from ever becomin' president. Quitcher daydreamin', melonhead."
0,Homer Simpson,"Bart's shirt is a classic, Marge. Just like ""Keep On Truckin'"". As if I would ever want to stop truckin'."
0,Homer Simpson,Where-where are we going?
11,Seymour Skinner,"But worst of all, he drags down the grades of anyone who sits near him. Just look at this pattern."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ohhh... kids, you can come in now."
9,Moe Szyslak,That thing knows me better than I know myself.
3,Bart Simpson,I'unno. I kinda want a cigarette.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, she must have some kind of super-chore in there! Like getting the rat out of Maggie's room!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Touchdown, Simpson! The boy nobody wanted just won the Superbowl!!!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"I've been-- Hey, how ya doin'?"
8,Ned Flanders,"We may be going to hell for seeing ""side bosom,"" but this backyard is a little slice of Heaven, all thanks to Homer Simpson!"
3,Bart Simpson,IT STILL WASN'T WORTH BURNS' SONG AND DANCE.
0,Homer Simpson,That got it.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, going to France sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but I think Bart should have a say in this."
8,Ned Flanders,"Just hold your horses, son. Hey, hey, Simpson."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Mom... Dad... there's a whale on the beach... You've gotta help me get her back in the ocean!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, of course. A little roughhousing with the pets is good for a man's appetite."
0,Homer Simpson,"I mean, nooo!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hi, I'm Homer Simpson. I need some guidance, counselor."
0,Homer Simpson,I am such a great parent to both my kids.
0,Homer Simpson,Orphans lighting candles over a leaking gas line... Lighting candles!
1,Marge Simpson,Hello. HEL-LOOO.
0,Homer Simpson,"Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
0,Homer Simpson,I TOLD GRAMPA WE'D BE AWAY
0,Homer Simpson,"I could just wear gloves. Nah, they're upstairs."
0,Homer Simpson,What the hell is this thing?
3,Bart Simpson,Good ol' Bluey.
1,Marge Simpson,You just need to develop a callous. See?
0,Homer Simpson,I can't wait for the reviews!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey Homer, you gonna kiss him or kill him?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, he ain't gettin' married. He has commitment issues!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, good, unfinished. This shouldn't take long."
11,Seymour Skinner,To get my mind off that ugly confrontation I went home and began bundling my old newspapers. But suddenly the pile fell. I was trapped. Let this be a lesson to recycle frequently.
3,Bart Simpson,"What's wrong, man?"
0,Homer Simpson,How can I control her?! I have nothing to withhold!
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I am focused on this like a laser. ""Laser."" That's a funny word. It's just ""loser"" with an ""a."" And speaking of losers, I've lost my train of thought. Oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--"
0,Homer Simpson,"That is small, right?"
0,Homer Simpson,Dr. Winslooooow...
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Ya-huh!
0,Homer Simpson,Congress shall have the Power To lay and collect Taxes... no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other Staaaate...
0,Homer Simpson,Moe... Moe... Moe.
0,Homer Simpson,I'd like to see that.
1,Marge Simpson,There's gotta be a clue here somewhere.
3,Bart Simpson,Your micro-jerks attacked me!
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, that is one lucky creepy guy."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, we did it, Dad."
7,Chief Wiggum,Instead of Praise-land.
5,Lisa Simpson,"HURRY NANNY, THINGS ARE"
6,Grampa Simpson,I'm scared. Can I sleep across ya?
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, that's a nice feature. Not much headroom, though..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Me, too!"
0,Homer Simpson,"That's it, kids. Suckle Daddy's sugar ball."
1,Marge Simpson,"That's a terrible thing to say. Kids, your father doesn't really mean that."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey losers, I'm gonna do to you what you did to these songs."
0,Homer Simpson,"Stupid Flandish. Uh, listen, since all the other fun stuff is out of bounds, how 'bout a little Bible-thumping in the crow's nest? What do you say, Miss..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"All right, all right. D.M.Y."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Hello. I'm proud to announce that we have been able to increase safety...
11,Seymour Skinner,"No. It's a new drug called ""Focusyn."""
9,Moe Szyslak,"Can you believe that Homer and Marge's marriage is just a sham? All right, I'll order. Um, I'll have a medium pepperoni. And can you space out the meat so it spells ""happy birthday Moe""? Oh, God I'm alone."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, Mr. Burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside..."
3,Bart Simpson,Please. You have something of mine on a little piece of paper.
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh no, not another boring space launch! Change the channel! Change the channel!"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Lights out, you punk kids!"
1,Marge Simpson,Disguises? I'm worried that our scam is becoming dishonest.
0,Homer Simpson,Did you see that? I did the deed! Open up!
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, I may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick, but that's, that's because my dad was so hard on me when I was a boy."
0,Homer Simpson,"Y'ello. This is he. Yeah I wanted to know: do you deliver falafels to the top of Mount Zion? Great. I'd like a large falafel with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese. Yes, I know what a falafel is."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, nothing. I just scheduled a tetanus booster. Maybe I'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Now, as a special send-off and a way to say ""Gung hay fat choy"" to our visiting Chinese principals, Bart Simpson has promised us a fireworks display!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Thank you, your honor."
1,Marge Simpson,"Busy day at work? Did you get a lot of work done, workerman?"
0,Homer Simpson,Ow! My ass!
3,Bart Simpson,Choose your corncob! En garde!
0,Homer Simpson,"Just call me ""Homer Fingerhands."""
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, thanks. Now how 'bout a dance with your Daddy?"

0,Homer Simpson,"Now, m'lady, your carriage awaits."
0,Homer Simpson,"I found this letter you wrote to my Mom, Mona Simpson."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, please wake up. If you do, I'll get you a new pony."
0,Homer Simpson,"Craig and Amy, Craig and Amy. Why don't you just marry Craig and Amy?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Uh-oh, looks like I gotta wing it a little bit here. The other day I ran into an Irishman. Oh really? No, O'Reilly."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, thanks for the heads-up! We'll see ya when we see ya!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Ohhh, my dear, sweet Eve. I love you even more than the butterscotch pond or the porno bush."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, come on! He doesn't have any money. Look at his clothes."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, maybe you should stop. We've talked about the gray zone..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I..."
1,Marge Simpson,I don't know. I'm trying to sleep.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, tell Dad I'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Come nightfall.
3,Bart Simpson,I think he's in the house!
0,Homer Simpson,They are all against me! They all must die!
0,Homer Simpson,"When you think about it, mud is nothing but wet dirt."
0,Homer Simpson,"Either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks Spanish."
3,Bart Simpson,"Maybe you could be a dunce, Father."
3,Bart Simpson,But what's with the glowing?
0,Homer Simpson,I've got it! It's in the bag!
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, Bill Gates is here."
1,Marge Simpson,"Doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now. So we'll need something a little more... affordable."
5,Lisa Simpson,"You like musicals, don't you Dad?"
0,Homer Simpson,The status quo.
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, those maps were drawn by the first explorers of this theme park, hundreds of years ago. Let's go."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,There's one thing I've always wanted to do.
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh... yeah, I have that disease that makes you look like an old man, but they gave me medicine for it and I took too much."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey man, can I bum a tent?"
5,Lisa Simpson,I swear there was a room here!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Dartmouth?! Get me away from this hideous brute at once!
0,Homer Simpson,He's named like my name!
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me."
0,Homer Simpson,Come on... fit you...
1,Marge Simpson,"All right, at least I can delete these Westminster Dog shows."
0,Homer Simpson,...and I wish that Mr. Teeny gets a banana ... that the Isotopes emerge from this season with a great blooper reel ... I wish that wishing wells worked so I wasn't just tossing my money away ... and that Marge loves me forever no matter what stupid things I do ...
0,Homer Simpson,Worrywart Marge. You don't look a Trojan Horse in the mouth.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Huh, their left taillight's a little smaller than their right one. I better pull 'em over."
0,Homer Simpson,"CALL MISTER PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME! THAT NAME AGAIN IS MISTER PLOW!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, so this is what this is."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, it's not easy with you talking all the time."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, we went to PatÃ© Labelle last week. How 'bout that?"
0,Homer Simpson,Those things?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. Come on, son."
1,Marge Simpson,"I know, he's changed."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, no, I mean I'm prepared to offer you a most generous cash settlement."
0,Homer Simpson,That piece of junk? Forget it! We're going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!
5,Lisa Simpson,I know. I'm sorry.
3,Bart Simpson,Must-drop-pantaloons.
3,Bart Simpson,Dad... I couldn't stay with Mom and Lisa while you were out here.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello? Yes, I'm Ned Flanders' close personal friend... that's right, hot and heavy... they've never been happier. Oh yes, I she does look pregnant. Now, who might you be? A tabloid? Is that one of those really strong mints? Hello? Hello?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Um... I just assumed?
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, nothing's perfect, I sure hate to make you come out here and not buy a house."
3,Bart Simpson,It's five in the afternoon!
8,Ned Flanders,Would a silly billy sit like this?
3,Bart Simpson,"Oo, tough room. Video games. Whaddaya got? ""Billy Graham's Bible Blaster""?!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh, yes, yes. Uh, carry on."
3,Bart Simpson,I'd sell my soul for a Formula One racing car!
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, we've been down this road before. I do something stupid, your Mom leaves, we eat waffles."

8,Ned Flanders,You threw it out the...
1,Marge Simpson,But we're on hiatus. Everyone's everywhere.
1,Marge Simpson,Look at Grampa and Selma frolicking in the water.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ladies, grab your pebbles!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Hello, Homie! Dinner's almost ready! Pork chops with my secret seasoning!"
3,Bart Simpson,Then can we get pizza on the way home?
11,Seymour Skinner,"What, a wall?"
3,Bart Simpson,I bet by the end of the night you're gonna look pretty good.
1,Marge Simpson,"When I joined, I never thought we'd be robbing people."
1,Marge Simpson,"Hmm, maybe we should spend more time with Bart. He's becoming isolated and weird."
1,Marge Simpson,"I wrote a poem for you this afternoon, Homer. It's called, ""To A Husband."""
3,Bart Simpson,Cue music.
9,Moe Szyslak,"No, the bees!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yes, I would. Class, everyone please stop and admire Juliet's painting..."
0,Homer Simpson,"And what if I ""wish"" to pay zero?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"...Miss Phipps, the school nurse, who will provide ointments and unguents...and Jimbo, the school bully who will administer noogies and nipple twisters."

10,Krusty the Clown,Don't wanna end up in Hell.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,You gotta say yes!
5,Lisa Simpson,"It's me, you idiot."

9,Moe Szyslak,Acquitted?! Then my nightmare isn't over?
0,Homer Simpson,It's a simple question! Are you A: Working hard or B:
5,Lisa Simpson,Neither do you!
5,Lisa Simpson,What about your family?
0,Homer Simpson,Then call KLONDIKE 5-3226. Call now and receive a free T-shirt.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well apparently, there's a secret garden in all of us. And that Lisa Simpson is guilty!"

0,Homer Simpson,No burning leaves without a permit!
8,Ned Flanders,All right officer.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I couldn't watch your demonstration of the fish caught in the plastic rings without getting an idea. Look out over the water.

0,Homer Simpson,It's your fault I'm bald!
6,Grampa Simpson,"Sorry, I been trying to forget those days for fifty years."
0,Homer Simpson,Aaah...
0,Homer Simpson,"That's all right, brain. If I die, I'll be doing the thing I love the most: trying not to get killed."
9,Moe Szyslak,I said I might.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, those are ice cream men."
1,Marge Simpson,Ooh! Who's a good boy?
1,Marge Simpson,"That sounds fine, Bart."
5,Lisa Simpson,Because I cleverly deduced the answer to Springfield's biggest ring. Voila!
1,Marge Simpson,You're already drinking at eight o'clock in the morning? How much have you had?
1,Marge Simpson,All eggnog is terrible!
11,Seymour Skinner,Mmm-hmm. There were kicks and everything.
1,Marge Simpson,Oh no...
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy after he saved my life. And, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him."
9,Moe Szyslak,"What's the matter, Homer? Hottest Ladies Night in months and you're not even checking out the action."
3,Bart Simpson,So you guys aren't ice cream men?
0,Homer Simpson,"What do ya think, Lisa?"
0,Homer Simpson,The dastard!
1,Marge Simpson,"Thanks for asking. Well, I was watching Dateline and Stone Philips said S.U.V.'s always roll over when you turn sharply, and the gas tanks explode at the drop of a hat."
3,Bart Simpson,Are you having a party or something?
5,Lisa Simpson,I've got something!

0,Homer Simpson,"Thanks, baby. Here, have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip."
1,Marge Simpson,See? The ladies know what I'm talkin' about.
7,Chief Wiggum,That was my insulin!

3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, that's my badge, Homer."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait a minute! Wait, that's it! I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence."
3,Bart Simpson,Booger.
0,Homer Simpson,Hello dere!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Don't worry, Bart. I brought something that'll keep you interested -- a nickel in a water bottle!"
0,Homer Simpson,The boy. Bring me the boy.
3,Bart Simpson,You ripped it off?
1,Marge Simpson,"Ned, I know you like to worry, but these boys are never going to get self-confidence unless you let them try things for themselves."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ah, c'mon, Homer, there's lasers. You like lasers."
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, it's past your bedtime."
1,Marge Simpson,There. Now that gum should lift right out.
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay Maggie, say your goodnights."
3,Bart Simpson,She put a spell on me!
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, Homer, nothing to be worried about... just--"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,We got a new coach!
5,Lisa Simpson,"You were right to kick me out of that game. Soccer was making me insane, just as it did the continents of Europe and South America."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh stop -- it's the journal of a sweet little girl! Keep reading, honey."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, what will we do if Santa's Little Helper doesn't learn anything in obedience school?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,This man is costing my health plan five thousand dollars a day. I demand that he die with dignity.

3,Bart Simpson,Did I make it?
0,Homer Simpson,"You won't be happy 'til my family thinks I'm a loser, will you?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, I'm gonna miss you."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, those peanuts aren't for you, they're for the elephant."
8,Ned Flanders,"Now I must bury my son, while you wander the earth forever, with the mark of evil upon your face."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, first I'll get that new hip I've been hankering for. Then, who knows? Bee keeping, boxing, bache ball?... The world is my oyster, Smithers. Farewell!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Alright, if you think you must."
0,Homer Simpson,"Son, let's forget all about that drug thing. Why don't you just come down and have some taffy?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Is it supposed to take this long? What's a good time for a mass evacuation of the entire plant?
5,Lisa Simpson,"I just want a simple salad with pine nuts, haricots verts, seasonal heirloom tomatoes..."
0,Homer Simpson,Why can't they just be happy for my success?
0,Homer Simpson,"C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize this is costing me money?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Yes. Funny that.
0,Homer Simpson,... Is it... Wah?
3,Bart Simpson,"No, you dweeb. It's a stencil. I'm gonna take Homer's ugly face and spread it all over town."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I want to die quietly, on my own terms, crushing as many of those baby sea turtles as I possibly can."
0,Homer Simpson,I guess it's one of those things a dad has to do...
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, so it is."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Jags are fine.
1,Marge Simpson,The doctor gave us this machine to help him breathe in his sleep. Go to bed. I'll take care of him.
0,Homer Simpson,And a circus fire!
5,Lisa Simpson,"All right! Now you've got all the Simpsons behind you, Apu!"
1,Marge Simpson,"No buts. You march right back to that school, look them straight in the eye and say ""don't eat me."""
0,Homer Simpson,Well I hope your son enjoys being driven around by the President of the United States.
0,Homer Simpson,Tell me what a cow says!
1,Marge Simpson,Turn it off.
3,Bart Simpson,Huh? Wahw!
0,Homer Simpson,This was supposed to be a mock battle! Mock!

0,Homer Simpson,I wish I'd never met you!

5,Lisa Simpson,Here we are!
11,Seymour Skinner,Would the world judge me harshly if I threw away the key?
0,Homer Simpson,Uh... actually my name is Barney. Yeah. Barney Gumbel.

1,Marge Simpson,He just needs it for walking upstairs.
0,Homer Simpson,That was beautiful. Can we go now?
9,Moe Szyslak,I'm behind three inches of bullet-proof glass. Do your worst.
5,Lisa Simpson,You do this every year. We are used to it.
5,Lisa Simpson,So many musical choices!
0,Homer Simpson,"I know. If I get really scared, I don't want to ruin the suit."
0,Homer Simpson,Boring. Let's watch something else.
0,Homer Simpson,"Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat."
3,Bart Simpson,I HEARD OL' NEIL PUT HER DOWN.

7,Chief Wiggum,"Whoa. Is that a five? Well, this uniform is a little snug! Oh yeah -- Woo!"
3,Bart Simpson,"With the money Dad's paying me, I rented a loft downtown."
6,Grampa Simpson,We're on our break!
1,Marge Simpson,That sounds great -- But only if your father promises to behave.
0,Homer Simpson,It's Ray! I see him again! Monster! You don't exist.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, great. Now I'm upside-down."
9,Moe Szyslak,This thing's hotter than Ellen Barkin!

0,Homer Simpson,"Is that green enough for you, sweetie? 'Cause I can make it greener..."
0,Homer Simpson,I know. I'm a character. Now a little beer music to get in the mood.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Fine. Should we take one car, or should I follow you?"
1,Marge Simpson,I think there's really something wrong with Santa's Little Helper. He was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad, I see a ride that actually looks decent!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"What are you doing, man? That's Carl! Let me help you."

5,Lisa Simpson,"No! Look, I'm not just gonna pick a religion that seems cool. I'm gonna pick one that's right for me."
1,Marge Simpson,"Goodnight, Bart."
0,Homer Simpson,"Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yup, beats school."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Canadian?! Them's fightin' words! I mean, accurate words."
3,Bart Simpson,Did you see that?
8,Ned Flanders,"Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days."
0,Homer Simpson,"The next day, we started auditioning for Chief Wiggum's replacement..."
8,Ned Flanders,What are you talking about? Neither boy lost.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Okay, we won't tell no one about that. Now let's see, what else can we do? We can't tickle Elmo no more."

0,Homer Simpson,"Uh-huh, where's the kids?"
0,Homer Simpson,Ohhh... a gym.
3,Bart Simpson,Lisa's your teammate?

0,Homer Simpson,Don't you dare post that review.
5,Lisa Simpson,"I was raised in a traveling circus. My mother was a lady ringmaster and my father was a lion barber. I wrote my first story with clown lipstick on a flattened popcorn box. It was featured in The New Yorker's ""Best Forty Under Four"" issue."
1,Marge Simpson,It's reassuring to see you're aware of the future. But this is all a little... creepy.
3,Bart Simpson,The best you'll ever have.
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! He's annoying. He's very, very annoying!"
11,Seymour Skinner,...integrity... trust... exploitation... the golden rule... role models... serious crime... zero tolerance... the Ten Commandments...
3,Bart Simpson,You betcha.
0,Homer Simpson,I love our court days.
0,Homer Simpson,"Last week's garbage. I missed the pick-up date. But it doesn't matter, because my Mom is alive. See?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm getting' out of the break-up business and I don't know if I'll ever sleep soundly again."
0,Homer Simpson,"Core temperature normal. Not too shabby. ""Vent radioactive gas?"" N-O."

0,Homer Simpson,Toilet hole.
1,Marge Simpson,I've got some good news. Krusty the Clown is coming to dinner tonight.
11,Seymour Skinner,Ned Flanders actually eliminated detention and put the whole school on the honor system?

9,Moe Szyslak,"Sure, whatever."
6,Grampa Simpson,Uh huh .. Uh-huh... You're allowed smoke cigars?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I'd better get you home."

0,Homer Simpson,Don't drink my loved ones!
9,Moe Szyslak,Oliver Klozoff! Call for Oliver Klozoff.

8,Ned Flanders,"Hiddily-ho, Blobareeno."
3,Bart Simpson,"Face the facts, has-been. This man is the comic book guy our town deserves!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Just run the camera, you little..."
0,Homer Simpson,They do good work.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Smithers?!
0,Homer Simpson,A little.
6,Grampa Simpson,"I used to drive, but they pulled my license."
3,Bart Simpson,"We'll tell ya, mom."
1,Marge Simpson,You mean a spoon?
0,Homer Simpson,"Whoa, who says that?"
1,Marge Simpson,The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, indigo!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Lady, I gotta tell ya -- I have been grossly misinformed about witches."

3,Bart Simpson,How'd you like to go on a real boat trip?
1,Marge Simpson,"Hmmm, you shouldn't do that."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Take a good long look at the innocent love in your son's eyes. 'Cause when he gets out of prison, it'll be gone forever. He will have a great bod, though. And a couple of those teardrop tattoos. Those are cool."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'm on duty."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooo, can I have dinner?"
11,Seymour Skinner,Dah! What the...?
0,Homer Simpson,Stupid poetic justice...!
0,Homer Simpson,"Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody."

1,Marge Simpson,"Go ahead, Maggie. You're allowed to touch the deadly weapons."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, somebody wants more crusts. Here you go, boy!"
6,Grampa Simpson,You're all dead too?
0,Homer Simpson,"I always was, honey. Look. Cameron's about to sing the song I wrote for him. He's about to learn the most important lesson in the music business: don't trust people in the music business."
1,Marge Simpson,"I may not know much about you, but you sure know a lot of wonderful things about me. And that means a lot to a woman."

0,Homer Simpson,I need help.
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay kids, time to apply the final ""date night"" touch. Lisa, spray just a hint of perfume on my neck, Bart, you tell me this dress doesn't make me look fat. And... now!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"You're under arrest, Simpson -- for grand theft auto! Now put up your hands!"
5,Lisa Simpson,You have a worldview both bleak and beautiful! I wanna write a report about you!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh Homie, I always believed you were gonna make it, no matter what that pushy casket salesman said."
3,Bart Simpson,Which way should we go?
0,Homer Simpson,I can't do it. I can't kill a man!
1,Marge Simpson,I'm afraid Homer and Bart's problems are beyond our power to solve.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Swiss Miss. There's no missin' you, babe. Heh, heh. Lay off the cocoa."
0,Homer Simpson,"Let's see now... ""BULLETIN: New Race Discovered Living Six Inches Under... Denver."""
0,Homer Simpson,I didn't want you to learn that word this way.
10,Krusty the Clown,This'd better be important. Oy gavolt!
3,Bart Simpson,And Santy Claus provides the rest.
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, no! It's Dad!"
1,Marge Simpson,Um... um...
0,Homer Simpson,It doesn't make sense to me!
3,Bart Simpson,Cool! I call the Flintstone Phone!

3,Bart Simpson,"Look Dad, it's the drummer from Bread!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity."
5,Lisa Simpson,Aren't you smart. Let's try another one... A little harder this time.
3,Bart Simpson,Hey! It's a free country. You get out.
5,Lisa Simpson,It happened to the scorpions too! The flower essence must have the side effect of lubricating the eye sockets to the point of popping.
0,Homer Simpson,Canyonero...
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, I found a clue that's gonna bust your mystery wide open!"
5,Lisa Simpson,You gotta give her up.

3,Bart Simpson,What next?
3,Bart Simpson,"Am not, am not, am not!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Brittany, do the honors."
0,Homer Simpson,TV said that? But I have to have a gun. It's in the Constitution.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, what a cute convertible. You guys at the bureau thought of everything."
3,Bart Simpson,That's Congresswoman Bella Abzug.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Have a blast, Mom!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Yeah, you know, that actually makes me feel a little better."
1,Marge Simpson,Homie... we actually have the cabin all to ourselves.
6,Grampa Simpson,Did you call the girl from the escort service?
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, I will! Son, I don't think you should let me help you."

6,Grampa Simpson,"Yes, the death race."
1,Marge Simpson,Major League Baseball?
5,Lisa Simpson,"How's it going, Bart?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"This trial un-separation stinks. My parents used to compete for my love, and I cashed in every time."

3,Bart Simpson,But I'm talkin' about Shaft.
0,Homer Simpson,Die!
0,Homer Simpson,Dressing?

5,Lisa Simpson,Fine. I'll shut down the site.
1,Marge Simpson,Awww... Eww... Homie! We still have a chance!
0,Homer Simpson,Now that's what I call a snappy retort!
1,Marge Simpson,I sure am!
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, well, it serves you right for eavesdropping."
3,Bart Simpson,You could fix up the old Storytime Village. They've been out of business ever since that kid got his head cut off.
5,Lisa Simpson,You're ruining the earth.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yo, Lenny... ...do you know anything about... flying the blimp while drinking..."
1,Marge Simpson,He has a point...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Now dad, I'd like to give you your present."
0,Homer Simpson,Turn the television to what channel?
3,Bart Simpson,"Not what I was hoping for, but it'll do."
1,Marge Simpson,"All right, we get it!"
6,Grampa Simpson,If you can't build a robot... be a robot!
6,Grampa Simpson,"No, the Hindu guy."
0,Homer Simpson,False.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, thank you good sir."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Everyone, wait!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Uh, near as we can tell, the boy was studying quietly when the girl, drunk on her own sense of power, beat him silly with a block of frozen lima beans."
8,Ned Flanders,"You know how you said you could help me with any desire and nothing was forbidden? Well, sir, I want you to rid of Lisa's bully teacher."
1,Marge Simpson,No they didn't.
0,Homer Simpson,"But before I go, I'm gonna give you a little souvenir of my own."
0,Homer Simpson,I found them on the night stand this morning. I guess they weren't his cup of tea. Don't worry about it.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, that's wonderful."
1,Marge Simpson,These are for Lisa's class.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I've been thinking, too. You know, Homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, Mr. Berger promised I could come back to my old job anytime I wanted."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?"
1,Marge Simpson,"You are unique, you are special, and at some point that's gonna come together and work for you. I know it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm glad everyone's all right, but I think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for TV ratings."
0,Homer Simpson,IT'S BART'S MOON PARTY FROM OUTER SPACE...
0,Homer Simpson,"Hi, Formico."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, whatever takes my mind off my life."
0,Homer Simpson,"So, Ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey mister, would you like a puppy?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Dad! Push exit!
1,Marge Simpson,Wake up! You're alive! You're alive!
1,Marge Simpson,Murder-suicides.
1,Marge Simpson,Here's my mask!
5,Lisa Simpson,It looks Japanese.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Why don't you just take my blood?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh my God. She's gonna jump. Marge, don't do it! Give divorce a chance!"
1,Marge Simpson,It's like God's vacuum cleaner!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as I consecrate another gay union that angers you so."
5,Lisa Simpson,THREE AWESOME KIDS AND A LIFE OF REGRET!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,The watchdog of public safety. Is there any lower form of life?
3,Bart Simpson,Wow! It's filthy... and it's mine.
0,Homer Simpson,Up or down?
0,Homer Simpson,Kill! Kill. Kill.
3,Bart Simpson,Right here?
1,Marge Simpson,No we're not. You're going down.
1,Marge Simpson,"So Bart, how's your big school presentation coming along?"
3,Bart Simpson,What have I done?
0,Homer Simpson,Whew! I was afraid it was my transmission.
3,Bart Simpson,Culture's in decline! Deal with it!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I didn't say ""Monty says!"" Now I have cause to terminate!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, I need those cookies for Santa."
1,Marge Simpson,"Time for Homer's half-time show. Get ready, Frank."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I think you'll find that deep down, anyone can be civilized. Goodnight, Willie."
3,Bart Simpson,"Sometimes I wonder about all the people in this town. Do you think anything interesting ever happens to them? I mean, there must be thousands of great stories out there."
3,Bart Simpson,"Quiet, Piggy, or we'll stick an apple in your mouth. We can't take any chances. We'll have to take turns watching him."
0,Homer Simpson,Because... the thingee was... shut up.
0,Homer Simpson,"Good, 'cause I need directions."
3,Bart Simpson,"I can't wait to see Grampa kick some ass! He's always pretended to be boring, but he's really a straight-up psycho!"
8,Ned Flanders,"IF YOU THINK I'M CUDDLY / AND YOU WANT MY COMPANY / COME ON WIFEY LET ME KNOW... UGH, UGH, UGH... OOOH..."
3,Bart Simpson,"When I think begging, I don't imagine someone standing up."
5,Lisa Simpson,This is horrible. People will start to avoid Springfield.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Not mine. It's a sham, Bart. You get up on that big screen pretending to be a hero, but you're not. The real heroes are out there, toiling day and night on more important things."
9,Moe Szyslak,It don't need no writing on it. It don't even have to be clean.
6,Grampa Simpson,Really? You're sweet.
0,Homer Simpson,"Why so formal, Lenny? You're my go-to guy."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Come on, Dad!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, I'll give you something to cry about, ya loser! You can't catch a football?! Let's see if you can catch a rock!"
1,Marge Simpson,I don't want to pump my little boy full of drugs.
3,Bart Simpson,"Ugh, I think I'd rather just get to work, Ma'am."
0,Homer Simpson,Hunh?
1,Marge Simpson,"Homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Uh, yeah... Well, he was turning into a monster, though."
0,Homer Simpson,"That reminds me -- Troy said something interesting last night at the bar. Apparently he doesn't really love Selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Well, enough talk. Let's snuggle."
1,Marge Simpson,A musical doorbell!
3,Bart Simpson,"And now, the next event...in our Living Room Olympics... the always controversial, couch vault. I do this for Stain Master Carpets. Proud sponsor of the Living Room Olympics."
10,Krusty the Clown,"Gimme, gimme, gimme!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh... oh, I hate Halloween."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, I don't go to where you work and read the bible to you!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Now, Maude, in our movie, you lay baby Moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. Okay? Lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- Action Jackson!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Dad! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
1,Marge Simpson,Bart's gay?
5,Lisa Simpson,"You know, spiritually speaking, Grandma's ashes won't know where they've been thrown from... So, in a way... uh... I'm lying down now."
5,Lisa Simpson,It's all so barbaric.
5,Lisa Simpson,Forgive me for this.
0,Homer Simpson,"Julia, wait!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, quit it!"
0,Homer Simpson,Well it's been two hours. How do you feel?
0,Homer Simpson,Fridge-ra-torr!
3,Bart Simpson,I want to own a muffin store. Great idea! Now let's see...
1,Marge Simpson,"There was more than enough in the swear jar. And if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise."
3,Bart Simpson,How'd you like to be played by John Goodman?
3,Bart Simpson,Fancy party! This is like a rap video before the rappers show up.
3,Bart Simpson,Hang on. Wait a minute.
3,Bart Simpson,The sandbox!
0,Homer Simpson,"Great. Now, let me think... the food was... not undelicious..."
8,Ned Flanders,"Dear Lord, thank you for creating so many evil criminals for us to bring in. And also, thank you for my partner Homer, who..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?"
1,Marge Simpson,Sorry. Dear God... you know which one I mean... thank you for returning our Homie. He's still got a lot of unfinished business down here.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, Smithers, don't you know how to paint the town red."
0,Homer Simpson,I can't believe I ate the whole thing.
0,Homer Simpson,"Now Marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake..."
1,Marge Simpson,"No, no, no, you have to try it on."
3,Bart Simpson,"Relax, Lis. Dad and I always have a Plan B."
0,Homer Simpson,No you won't.
3,Bart Simpson,"Ooh, algebra... I'll just do a few equations. No! No more distractions!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, Young man Burns."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh great, now that Dad's gonna star in it."
1,Marge Simpson,You like ballet?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Heyyyy, I like it! I like it a lot!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"I can't afford any of your products, but can I buy some fake white earbuds, so people will think I have a MyPod?"
5,Lisa Simpson,That's so poetic.
0,Homer Simpson,And I feel that you hear my shame.
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, what's this world coming to?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Let's see, sweater... custom floor mat... the stereo!"
0,Homer Simpson,"But there is, Marge! The first two letters..."
3,Bart Simpson,"French it up, lover boy!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, you are comparing me to the most infuriating thing in the newspaper!"
0,Homer Simpson,I'm buying a round of the fanciest drink you got.
0,Homer Simpson,"If you really love Larry, prove it and you can have him back today."
1,Marge Simpson,"Will you get serious, Homer? I'd like to win at least once."
0,Homer Simpson,Krusty's gone nuts...
5,Lisa Simpson,"An F?! Okay, this is the time when I always wake up."
3,Bart Simpson,IF YOU TRY TO RUN / YOU'LL GET A HEART ATTACK...
0,Homer Simpson,The ghost of Marge Future!
1,Marge Simpson,It's not a skirt. It's a kilt!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I'm no matinee idol.
0,Homer Simpson,Forget it pal. I don't need your phoney baloney job. I'll take your money but I'm not gonna plow your driveway.
3,Bart Simpson,Help! Let me out! I have my doubts about this licorice!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Well look at this, you dragged me back to my old neighborhood. And it hasn't changed a bit."
1,Marge Simpson,It's in that dumpster.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, uh... you know what they say, ""hammer with the wood and it's all good."""
0,Homer Simpson,Leave Ned alone.
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, that's it. Let's get ready to meet our public."
0,Homer Simpson,"Quiet, honey. Daddy's asking the man a question."
1,Marge Simpson,It's not a big deal. We'll just go to City Hall and get married there.
5,Lisa Simpson,Part two...
3,Bart Simpson,"Well actually, Mom--"
0,Homer Simpson,"No, mon, let's go home to Jamaica. I and I been in Babylon too long."
0,Homer Simpson,It's dark in here!
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, you've always been cool to me. But Homer is a lousy dad and I'm not gonna take it anymore."
0,Homer Simpson,"Up-bup-bup! Don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Where's my monster, Tubby? What do you people think I'm paying you for?"
0,Homer Simpson,Save me Chaka Khan! Chaka Khannnn!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, that depends."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, that's kind of a gray area."
3,Bart Simpson,This one. Artillery...commence saturation bombing.
11,Seymour Skinner,Excuses are like handkerchiefs -- everybody's got one.
1,Marge Simpson,"Now if there's anything, anything at all I can do to help out..."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, no, no cord at all... on those. Hey, game's on!"
1,Marge Simpson,That's great. I wonder what surprise your father has in store.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's not a real kidnapping. It's a simple hoax to win a father's love."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, nothing... How would you feel if I did some volunteer work at the prison?"
0,Homer Simpson,Careful now.
0,Homer Simpson,"A ""Forget-Me-Shot?"" Never heard of it."
9,Moe Szyslak,But Blanche! You gotta help me out here. Please! I'm sixty-four grand in the hole. They're gonna take my thumbs!
0,Homer Simpson,I'm rich!
8,Ned Flanders,"Please, Lord, grant me the power to psychologically torture them into loving you."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, my Dad never even knew how I felt about him."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"My God, are you always on?"
0,Homer Simpson,I never found true happiness until I met Marge.
0,Homer Simpson,"Man, you should come over to our place. It's full of valuable, worthless crap!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, you have a job?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Now, don't get too used to these. That awful doctor said he'd take them out in a couple of days."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, it'll be easy. You've still got most of the stuff from Apu's wedding back there."
8,Ned Flanders,It's the Four Elephants of the Apocalypse!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, my head. How long have I been out here?"
0,Homer Simpson,How's it goin'?
0,Homer Simpson,"If it doesn't matter, then I call Snickers."
0,Homer Simpson,I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
11,Seymour Skinner,She wants to break up?
0,Homer Simpson,"Sure, I'll stay home and Skype with the guys at Moe's."
3,Bart Simpson,I need an operation?
0,Homer Simpson,"Nothing a month? Yeah, I think we can swing that."
1,Marge Simpson,Very close...
3,Bart Simpson,You should call that radio station and let 'em have it.
0,Homer Simpson,Wait! Not so fast! We found something to save Krusty.
9,Moe Szyslak,Who can say? It's probably a combination of things.
5,Lisa Simpson,Let me see that.
6,Grampa Simpson,And I created an alcoholic hippo!
0,Homer Simpson,It must have been Moe!
1,Marge Simpson,Which is impossible!
0,Homer Simpson,Anger's a mood!
0,Homer Simpson,It was all just a dream.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Um, excuse me, but I think her painting is very imaginative."
5,Lisa Simpson,Did the maniac kill her?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"All right. Well, let's have a look at my stock portfolio."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, thanks, guys. I ain't never been to no fancy rooftop party before."
0,Homer Simpson,MIGHT I ADD -- NO FAT CHICKS.
0,Homer Simpson,Marge! No! Stop packing your--
3,Bart Simpson,I see a neck!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, will this horrible year never end?"
3,Bart Simpson,No reason. Brother.
3,Bart Simpson,Ow! Hey watch those virtual darts. I'm trying to play virtual pool!
0,Homer Simpson,People with heads?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Your metabolism will change someday, too, young man."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm giving it back to the earth."
3,Bart Simpson,What's stopping you?
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I don't need much help..."
1,Marge Simpson,Lettuce who?
5,Lisa Simpson,... So I sent Luke's sister down the wrong trail and... Hey! Where'd all this water come from? There used to be a trail here! And there used to be a beaver dam there.
0,Homer Simpson,You're already in a home.
3,Bart Simpson,Eh? Eh? Eh?
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, I need to leave you where you'll be safe...under the watchful eyes of God. And I'll be watching you too, in case God's busy making tornadoes or not existing."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, come on, Marge. Why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Aw sweetie, money can't change people. It can just help them be who they are. I gave a bum a dollar once and he used it to buy an Ellery Queen mystery. But there was one mystery Ellery Queen couldn't solve: why a man was named Ellery. But my point is, whatever I said before I started talking about Ellery Queen."
5,Lisa Simpson,Swim toward San Francisco!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yes, sing us a song!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey McBain, I'm a big fan, but your last movie really sucked."
1,Marge Simpson,Now this is spoiling them.
5,Lisa Simpson,Because you've already done it once.
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, people. We've got to buckle down here. When we're finished, we can go through Bill Clinton's porno stash..."
0,Homer Simpson,"But won't you be jealous, my love?"
7,Chief Wiggum,What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?
1,Marge Simpson,You never looked up to him.
3,Bart Simpson,You all stink!
3,Bart Simpson,Whoa! The infamous Wolverine comic with pop-out claws!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, I can't get Artie out of my head. He's like a spy in the house of Moe."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, I was just thinking you might have some in the back you haven't put out yet."
1,Marge Simpson,"The doctor said if you tried running again, your ankles would shatter."
1,Marge Simpson,That number's so big it has a comma!
11,Seymour Skinner,Mother!!!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Buck, this is a real honor. I grew up watching your horse operas down at the Bijou."
0,Homer Simpson,Heeeeey...
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. You're thirty-eight years old, you don't know how to box and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. Before you even consider this, I insist you consult a doctor."
1,Marge Simpson,"Your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, Homer."
0,Homer Simpson,"When you say ""teacher,"" do you really mean ""parent?"""
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, then you think of something!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"I get it. Every week they send out two pamphlets, half picking one team and half picking the other. Eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think Professor Pigskin is always right! That's when they ask for your money."
3,Bart Simpson,"I'll give it a whirl, Ralphie boy."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Yes, yes it is, sir."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I don't need a co-anchor. I'm a straight ""A"" student."
0,Homer Simpson,"Give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine."
0,Homer Simpson,"So, who won? The losers?"
6,Grampa Simpson,I don't like this program.
3,Bart Simpson,"Whoa, something's wrong! Ah, ah, I can't hear!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Wrong, we're saved! Sea gulls always stay near land. They only go out to sea to die."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Simpson, wait! As it turns out, there is one job available. But be forewarned, it promises naught but soul-crushing boredom."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Lord, I'm not turning my back on You. I just need to find a temple that's free of corruption."
0,Homer Simpson,Isn't bad? Tell me one thing mankind's ever done that's any better.
10,Krusty the Clown,CHANNEL-HOPPIN' RIT'LIN-POPPIN' MONK-EYS / But please don't quit the fan club.
1,Marge Simpson,"You can have the shower to yourself, Homie. I'm finished."
5,Lisa Simpson,He's at the peak of cuteness.
3,Bart Simpson,"Legend has it a girl named Eleanor Mackie drowned on this very spot. Now they say if you call her name three times while looking in this mirror, you will die. Milhouse?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, Homer's my soul mate! And you don't dump a soul mate!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Thank you, Bart, for fixing my vision / Now I see with total precision."
1,Marge Simpson,"Now, Lisa tell your side of the story. And use your big voice."
3,Bart Simpson,Nothing a few George Washingtons won't solve.
0,Homer Simpson,You broke a promise to your child.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Look Smithers! Garbo is coming!
1,Marge Simpson,A competent doctor!
5,Lisa Simpson,Have you ever seen such exquisite Ushabtis?
1,Marge Simpson,It's hard to get in the mood... with all those murderous eyes staring at us...
0,Homer Simpson,"Really? You want my help? Marge, did you hear that? Mel Gibson wants my help! Mel Gibson!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"40 cents? Ach, my Grampa Zev would turn over in his grave if it wasn't filled with some veteran!"
3,Bart Simpson,She's in the back yard!
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase."
0,Homer Simpson,"Eh, maybe I'll vote democrat. The great thing is when they get in they act like Republicans."
5,Lisa Simpson,That music always sends a chill down my spine.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, that. We were actually just going out for brunch and I got lost. But don't worry, officer. We'll definitely have a talk with the boy."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, maybe I lied. But you've been so needy... ""I'm hungry,"" ""I'm itchy,"" ""that's not my blood type..."""
8,Ned Flanders,Yea-- What?
0,Homer Simpson,And decrepit.
5,Lisa Simpson,"I knew you were, Dad. I always knew."
1,Marge Simpson,You are NOT going to perform that operation yourself.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. The Fourth of July is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into America's car window. God bless her."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I guess your new name is really opening doors for you."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm an idiot! Of course! I get Marge to marry Moe, then I kill Moe, then she gets the ring, then I marry her, and the ring is mine. And the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity!"
1,Marge Simpson,No way I'm cleaning up this mess.
5,Lisa Simpson,That caterpillar is screaming.
1,Marge Simpson,"Aww, what a sweet blasphemy."
1,Marge Simpson,I lost my other earring.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get out of this?"
1,Marge Simpson,What about Mr. Burns? Maybe he'll help us out.
3,Bart Simpson,You'll rent nothing! This money is mine. I found it!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Yes! That's the kind of moxie I'm looking for. You're hired!
11,Seymour Skinner,This air conditioning is better than any truant officer. I'm seeing students I haven't seen in years.
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, honey, would you like some more cod liver oil?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh yeah? Remember this? ""Higher, Dad, higher!... Whee, whee... Push harder, Dad!..."""
1,Marge Simpson,Who wants some Astro-lemonade?
0,Homer Simpson,Follow instructions? He's doomed!
0,Homer Simpson,"Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Now as you all know, Springfield's 200th birthday is only a week away. Every class will do its part to make our local bicentennial just as memorable as our National Bicentennial. Of course, you children are too young to remember that -- with the possible exception of Kearney."
0,Homer Simpson,Maggie! Cut that racket!
0,Homer Simpson,I'll always be there. Not even death will stop me.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, oh, Homer. I feel giddy. Wait, what about a babysitter?"
1,Marge Simpson,I didn't mean to use that word! It's okay to have a feminine side. It's good in fact!
5,Lisa Simpson,I think they're running out of tomatoes.
8,Ned Flanders,"Oh no, ""Games"" stands for Gathering of American Messengers for Evangelical Sports!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Wow, for the first time in my life, someone's taking a genuine interest in what's inside of me. Suddenly, this is my best birthday ever!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Don't worry. Mr. Teeny's got a flaming arrow.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,But does your wife?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine."
1,Marge Simpson,You could give the money to the orphanage. I hear they need a new wall.
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, I won't embarrass you."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Take, potion! Hurry!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, a freak show!"
0,Homer Simpson,I don't get it. Why don't people like my art anymore?
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, ready."
0,Homer Simpson,Why you little...!
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't be a fool, Aunt Selma. That man is scum."
0,Homer Simpson,What kind of beer?
0,Homer Simpson,"Eh, he had a good run."
0,Homer Simpson,Or else what?
9,Moe Szyslak,I got hooked on this stuff in the service.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Visual aids help so much. Thank you.
5,Lisa Simpson,No! It's evil! Please stop recycling!
8,Ned Flanders,"Wake up, Flanders! There is no Hell, and there is no God. If there were, would He let me do this?"
3,Bart Simpson,Who the hell are you?
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, I don't need you. I've learned to take care of myself."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Lisa, you can't have my cupcake."
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, I loved it, too, but it was seven years ago."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- that's something."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, Moe and I are just work friends. You and I are... marriage friends."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Actually Dad, this time I was wrong..."
0,Homer Simpson,Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, then. I guess I'll just have to get into the crawl space again."
5,Lisa Simpson,We will.
5,Lisa Simpson,It can't just be a bad day. I feel like I'm getting dumber by the minute.
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, you're kind of a downer."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"But, I'm sleepy."
5,Lisa Simpson,And George Washington took a trip down the...ear-y Canal!
0,Homer Simpson,Now it's two sets of twins.
1,Marge Simpson,YOU LIGHT UP MY DAYS / AND FILL MY NIGHTS / WITH SONG.... IT CAN'T BE WRONG / WHEN IT FEELS SO GOO/RIGHT / CAUSE YOU -- YOU
3,Bart Simpson,...and murder and swears and brains and basements...
1,Marge Simpson,You're a pretty girl.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad, heard you swearing. Mind if I join in? Crap. Boobs. Crap."
1,Marge Simpson,C'mon! C'mon! Get that corpse off the road! The streets are for the living!
7,Chief Wiggum,"Ah heck, it's just an old shopping cart."
0,Homer Simpson,"Aw, I can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions."
6,Grampa Simpson,...and watchin' our backs was Private Fifth-Class Arnie Gumble.
5,Lisa Simpson,You aren't being persuaded by the content of my argument -- you're being convinced by the color of my hair!
0,Homer Simpson,"And I gave that man directions, even though I didn't know the way. 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am this week."
3,Bart Simpson,...for me.
0,Homer Simpson,"What are you lookin' at, buddy?"
1,Marge Simpson,Chief Wiggums! The maestro is the killer!
6,Grampa Simpson,More breast?
6,Grampa Simpson,"Molloy said, 'I'll catch up with you.'"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"They sure do, Strawberry."
5,Lisa Simpson,"HASHTAG ""SPRINGFIELD PRIDE"" HAS NEVER EVER TREND-ED."
0,Homer Simpson,"Who are you, stuttering Fonzie? What about you, bicycle pants?"
1,Marge Simpson,Fish scales?
0,Homer Simpson,Your last act as a mom was to make me a better dad. But at least now I'll never lose you again.
11,Seymour Skinner,Excellent! Free play cancelled!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Did you hear that, Bart? That was the tardy bell. ""Truant! Truant! Truant!"" they'll all say!"
3,Bart Simpson,Nelson.
3,Bart Simpson,Dad? Please? For Sumadi?
3,Bart Simpson,Just let 'em ring.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Thank you, Krusty!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"I know those words, but that sign makes no sense."
11,Seymour Skinner,"And for the first time ever, our computer lab actually has a computer in it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, labels."
3,Bart Simpson,"You spent your life searching for these, but you never had one."
3,Bart Simpson,I guess I am an embarrassment.
1,Marge Simpson,"Children, bedtime."
0,Homer Simpson,"Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life."
0,Homer Simpson,"Die, you chalk-faced goons!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes."
10,Krusty the Clown,Do you want some monkey meat to replace it?
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooo, Arthur Fortune. You know what that fabulous man just did? He gave the Springfield zoo two male Pandas, and got them to mate successfully."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"That's the kind of man I need on my team, Smithers. A real scrapper. A self-made man like me. Bring this Grimes fellow to me. I want to make him my executive vice president."
7,Chief Wiggum,Now take that kid away.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Okay, Jupiter should be somewhere around here..."
3,Bart Simpson,"Lis, Skinner is using you. Like a pawn on his unholy chess set."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, okay, Dad. I promise. I will not jump Springfield Gorge."
1,Marge Simpson,You're the worst husband in the world!
0,Homer Simpson,"We'll do our best, honey. Now let's get goin'."
11,Seymour Skinner,Um... that uh... bake sale revenue projections are through the roof.
0,Homer Simpson,Oooh! Oh! Krusty!
5,Lisa Simpson,Complete confidentiality? Oh. And I'm sure he's as good as Dr. Hibbert. It says so right in his ad.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, does that even mean anything?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Dad looks so happy.
0,Homer Simpson,"Um, Mrs. Simpson?"
0,Homer Simpson,You sure love driving.
1,Marge Simpson,Bad dog!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, how much did I eat?!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Okay, going down the checklist: feu allumÃ©...oui. Ballon gonflÃ©, oui."
7,Chief Wiggum,Knock yourself out.
5,Lisa Simpson,"We may have to live on this food for a long time, so no more till tomorrow."
0,Homer Simpson,"Bullseye! And another thing. When I gun the motor, I want people to think the world is coming to an end! VROOM! VROOM! VROOM!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't say that! Maybe I can sneak you back in. I mean, God can't be everywhere at once, right?"
3,Bart Simpson,"hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, if anything, you owe them."
3,Bart Simpson,Are there other people in here?
1,Marge Simpson,"We're fine, Colonel. Good day."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes."
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay... There's a song about, um... how Democrats and Republicans can't get along. It's called ""Cats and Dogs."""
1,Marge Simpson,Lisa...
0,Homer Simpson,"Shh, quiet."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Children, it seems the phone lines are down. So I'm afraid we're stuck here for the duration."
0,Homer Simpson,Mm hmm.
1,Marge Simpson,"What do you do, follow my husband around?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time."
3,Bart Simpson,"No, Dad, I should really... Whoop!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Whoa, excellent haul!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh no, Bart blamed this on the dog! I didn't pet him for weeks! Oh, I'm sorry I doubted you, boy."
0,Homer Simpson,"Bart, Bart. We're home, son."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, it's always in the last place you look."
5,Lisa Simpson,I saw the best meals of my generation destroyed by the madness of my brother / My soul carved in slices by spikey-haired demons...
0,Homer Simpson,"So I said ""if this is the house of pancakes, how come I can't eat the walls?"""
0,Homer Simpson,"H means ""hot""?!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Attention Christians, Muslims, and Jews. I have come to gather you into a new faith. From now on you shall be called Chrismujews."

0,Homer Simpson,"New York is a hellhole, and you know how I feel about hellholes."
0,Homer Simpson,Turn that down!
1,Marge Simpson,I know you're upset --

3,Bart Simpson,Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! / Woo! Woo! Woo!
5,Lisa Simpson,Wait... you named me after a train?
0,Homer Simpson,Lovin' it!
5,Lisa Simpson,I'll do anything but sing!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Sure, Homer, I can loan you all the money you need. However since you have no collateral, I'm gonna have to break your legs in advance."
9,Moe Szyslak,"That's right. And if the ref's not looking, you can kick him a coupla times."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, except for Chubsy-Ubsy over there."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I lost Dad and Bart."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, I was wrong. The lizards are a godsend."
10,Krusty the Clown,I've never had such a great assistant!
3,Bart Simpson,"I know, but I'm still not gonna do it."
3,Bart Simpson,"Um, I don't know how much more school I can miss."
1,Marge Simpson,The kids?
0,Homer Simpson,That's quite an offer -- can I discuss it with my wife?
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm sorry I was so stubborn. I hope you're not mad.
0,Homer Simpson,"That's it! Thank you, outdoor advertising! You saved my marriage -- and not for the first time."
0,Homer Simpson,"OH, I LOVE TO PERAMBULATE / IT'S STANDING STILL I REALLY HATE / SO LET ME PLEASE REITERATE / I LOVE TO..."

8,Ned Flanders,Hi-dilly-ho Shary Bobbins!
1,Marge Simpson,I want to talk to Howard.
0,Homer Simpson,I know. It's where I hide my adult magazines.
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, good morning, Lord. I just have to, ah, compliment you on this beautifully crafted mate."
3,Bart Simpson,Nah. These days everything's done on computers.
0,Homer Simpson,"East Oak Street, is that it?"
0,Homer Simpson,"What's your problem, boy?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Only if he fibbed about his name, age, and occupation on this automated eight-hundred number."
8,Ned Flanders,"Thanks, but... what are you holding on to?"
0,Homer Simpson,Let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. We've got something more important to attend to.
7,Chief Wiggum,"He's got your kid, but don't worry. Everything is gonna be okay."
3,Bart Simpson,Maps to movie stars homes! Mapa por las casas de las cineastas! Top-u stah noh cheezu map-u!
1,Marge Simpson,I've got amnesia and I have three kids.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm not... I'm not good."
1,Marge Simpson,See? Luckiest man in the world.
1,Marge Simpson,"""Rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame""."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Alright, what does this mean?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad! We made popcorn!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Concentrate, Homer."
11,Seymour Skinner,Whoever discovers them. I've been hoping I could find something that would be named after me.
0,Homer Simpson,Sir --
8,Ned Flanders,Seen the paper?
1,Marge Simpson,Oh my God. We're out on the street!
3,Bart Simpson,"Lady Gaga, meet your biggest threat: Baby Googoo."
0,Homer Simpson,"Y... Y... Y... Let's see, so many letters to choose from. I'll pick Y."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I believe you."
0,Homer Simpson,"I said, pull my finger."
1,Marge Simpson,I guess it's never the most likely suspect.
7,Chief Wiggum,Not compared to this.
1,Marge Simpson,Time to go to the reunion.
0,Homer Simpson,We've gone on plenty of great vacations.
1,Marge Simpson,"Kids, look what I got you for your third grade field trip -- matching fanny packs!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Ow! Ooh... ow... Mother of Mercy... Hey, this is kinda fun. Whee!!"
3,Bart Simpson,It's like you're living in a steakhouse!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, thank you, Shoppie. I... I ventured in to search for milk when the door snapped shut behind me."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I think the fangs today.
3,Bart Simpson,'Til the next one. So what'll we do now?
5,Lisa Simpson,Let's see... Crusty sores...
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, this is taffy!"
0,Homer Simpson,I'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,It should never stop dancing.
0,Homer Simpson,Tell me everything about you.
0,Homer Simpson,"Thank God. I'm out of matches. Oh no, here's another one."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I keep telling you, the ability to add two-digit numbers is not witchcraft!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Watch and learn, ya dinks."
0,Homer Simpson,Whoa! What's going on? Ow! Oh! This inner peace stuff is tough on the old coconut.
5,Lisa Simpson,Ta-da!
0,Homer Simpson,"Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?"
5,Lisa Simpson,That dinger was a fluke! Not that I have to defend myself to you. Managers manage and players play.
5,Lisa Simpson,Quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.
5,Lisa Simpson,Pony ride! Boat ride! Pony ride! Boat ride!
5,Lisa Simpson,"You're in big trouble, mister. I'm bleeding!"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,That's your take-away from Nemo? I think you've already made your feelings for Lisa clear.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Wait, that's not how you spell ""dumbening."" Wait, ""dumbening"" isn't even a word!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, Bart was taking a picture of his butt."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, Battlestar Galactica."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Big Daddy's trademark calling card. See, it's right here inside the skull."
0,Homer Simpson,Hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"""Don't forget, you're here forever."""
5,Lisa Simpson,Can I join you for lunch?
1,Marge Simpson,Really? Even Zima?
1,Marge Simpson,My head feels like it was punched by a boxing man.
0,Homer Simpson,What? Two dollar charge for non-network bank?!
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay boy, do something annoying. But leave yourself room to build."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Bah humbug.
3,Bart Simpson,Can I visit him tomorrow?
0,Homer Simpson,"Not so rough, Bart. Daddy can't handle so much love right now."
0,Homer Simpson,I liked that story 'cause I was a Judge.
11,Seymour Skinner,Enhance!
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay everyone, get ready to see your brand new..."
0,Homer Simpson,The boy's still studying?
0,Homer Simpson,Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?
1,Marge Simpson,"Wait, wait! That's a suggestion, not a threat!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"We start with Grade A beef, feed that to other cows, then kill them and serve the unholy results on a seven-grain bun. Burger Squared!"
0,Homer Simpson,It's cold outside. You'll need a sweater. A sweater!
0,Homer Simpson,"You just lost a box, pal!"
3,Bart Simpson,Bless you.
7,Chief Wiggum,Everything's work with you. Lighten up.
5,Lisa Simpson,"But that trivializes the whole idea of kids news. I mean, let's be honest. Bart's not exactly the brightest penny in the fountain."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh. Yes, of course. Uh, she's behind that plant."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Uh, I am! I'm strongly opposed to... Proposition, uh, 3-0-5..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, well."
1,Marge Simpson,"Quiet, you two! You know your father's had a breakdown."
1,Marge Simpson,You don't belong on the lawn. You belong in your bed with your wife!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, you're never alone surrounded by ""The Autobiography of Charles Manson."""
3,Bart Simpson,"Krusty, you don't have to be ""on"" tonight."
0,Homer Simpson,That's Ned Flanders. There's one in every neighborhood.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,...with...
0,Homer Simpson,Really? With butterscotch on it?
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, guys."
0,Homer Simpson,Those suck. They're worse than nothing. I could write way better songs.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, save me Jebus!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, you can hear us?"
0,Homer Simpson,"NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA LEADER / LEA-DER, LEA-DER, LEA-DER!"
0,Homer Simpson,"I won't let you give up now, when you've worked so hard to be the greatest pal in the world. I love you. Let's not lose touch after graduation."
0,Homer Simpson,"Excuse me, but my ""team"" is ready to bowl."
1,Marge Simpson,I've got rocks that need washing at home.
0,Homer Simpson,"Now I'm Michael Jackson. I own all your songs, losers. Hee, hee, hee."
1,Marge Simpson,Oh Grampa!
0,Homer Simpson,Maybe five bucks would refresh my memory.
5,Lisa Simpson,Old Man Winter!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, it's my job to cook him breakfast, and I'm gonna cook the best damned breakfast he ever ate!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Lisa Simpson, master of the double life."
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, I'm surprised. Your sister just wants to learn and be like you. Well, maybe she needs a better role model."
0,Homer Simpson,Wooooo! 'Topes ruuuule!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Finally, that jerk Homer is home!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, please. It's obvious you're Pie Man. We've been getting his mail for weeks."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, we're too heavy."
0,Homer Simpson,"You got that right. Throw on the mesquite, Bart!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I'll take ten bucks no-ow.
5,Lisa Simpson,No! Not Janey! She'll pack the Supreme Court with boys!
3,Bart Simpson,The cops found me driving on the sidewalk.
1,Marge Simpson,"After thirty-five years of wifely obedience, I'm married to a face on a screen."
3,Bart Simpson,I had a speech ready... but my dog ate it!
5,Lisa Simpson,Shut up!
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, maybe I'll go to Moe's too, seeing as I'm now part owner."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Never! President's Physical Fitness Test, Sealtest Ice Cream, Testor's Airplane Glue..."
0,Homer Simpson,"You give my son what he deserves, or I'll knock you on your delightfully offbeat ass!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't you badmouth this country. Compared to the rest of the third world, we're doin' great!"
0,Homer Simpson,Where? I don't see that.
1,Marge Simpson,Me too. Let's go home.
5,Lisa Simpson,Mom... can I visit Bob?
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey boy, this is your commercial!"
5,Lisa Simpson,What I want can't be bought at any store.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Or one of these other dining clubs? Look at them circling me like I'm Cinderella, belle of the ball!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, let's just move in."
0,Homer Simpson,Why you little... I'll endanger you!
5,Lisa Simpson,Aww... maybe a hug will cork her cry-hole.
0,Homer Simpson,"Although, wow!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Way to guard the parking lot, Top Gun."
3,Bart Simpson,Four hundred days. I can do that standing on my head.
3,Bart Simpson,"I'm starving. Mom, can we go Catholic so we get communion wafers and booze?"
5,Lisa Simpson,It sounded like a silo tipping over!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lis. Want some soup?"
0,Homer Simpson,Right. And how do I join? Do I whale on some Unitarians?
0,Homer Simpson,She thinks she's decided. Don't say a thing. Don't blow this!
3,Bart Simpson,"But you can't kill Krusty. He made you what you are. Without him, you wouldn't even be called Sideshow."
5,Lisa Simpson,I forgive you.
7,Chief Wiggum,We got intel-- that's short for a word I don't know...
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go."
0,Homer Simpson,Mmmm... Gummi Beer.
0,Homer Simpson,"No, no, I'm into chicken."
3,Bart Simpson,You realize you're cheering the death of millions of my children.
1,Marge Simpson,I'm going out. I run errands during the day.
9,Moe Szyslak,"So all you mugs out there, be sure you don't take for granted the woman you love. Oh, and it's Mother's Day, so call your ma."
3,Bart Simpson,My school picture!!
3,Bart Simpson,"I don't want your help! I'll get one of those jobs where you don't need to read, like French fry maker or general."
1,Marge Simpson,"Come on, Homer, let's get the kids out of here. Homer?"
0,Homer Simpson,I'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a ruse to get our money.
0,Homer Simpson,I'll take 'em.
1,Marge Simpson,I'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.
0,Homer Simpson,"Not ""trash can,"" son. Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder! Patent pending."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently."
0,Homer Simpson,Where's the beef? No wonder he won Minnesota.
0,Homer Simpson,I remember.
1,Marge Simpson,"No, I will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!"
11,Seymour Skinner,There's no one for miles.
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, after that lame party you threw, I'd rather hang out with thunder-thighs here."
6,Grampa Simpson,That's my boy Homer singing!
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, eat my shorts. Buttman... da da da da da da da da... Buttman."
1,Marge Simpson,"So you see, Ms. Zengler, the Mother Hubbard's Express across the street is stealing all our business. It's not fair."
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, wipe your feet."
0,Homer Simpson,Happy... Valentine's Day!
0,Homer Simpson,"Trying to kill Moe so we'll get his emerald. By the way, I haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Ha! Ha! This sting can't miss, boys. I mailed these bogus prize certificates to every scofflaw in Springfield."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody! Let's hear it for Bart!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Princess, why did you put on that coat? You're obviously cold. May I escort you to the radiator?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, let me just say I want to put the ""stew"" back in students."
0,Homer Simpson,Dad! It's the third Sunday of the month. You know what that means.
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, no. Ties."
0,Homer Simpson,"Laundry. Homework. Pranks. Poop, poop and poop."
3,Bart Simpson,"Great game, Lis."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Homie, I'm so glad to hear you say that."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, Flanders. Don't you have a neighbor on the other side?"
0,Homer Simpson,"""Rough!"" Ah, I don't know. You've been pitching that all night."
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm never eatin' chili again. Ooh, chili!"
0,Homer Simpson,Who's the greatest billionaire in the world?!
0,Homer Simpson,"I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, right. I mean, this looks like a dress from a local Springfield store. All is forgiven. Let's have dinner."
0,Homer Simpson,Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think.
0,Homer Simpson,I want free cable.
3,Bart Simpson,Perish the thought.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Die, ya bastard!"
5,Lisa Simpson,All Dad needs to do is put his stone inside that circle and they win.
8,Ned Flanders,"We've come for the angel, Homer. It's not safe with the unbeliever."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I'm not here for Bart. I'm here to teach you Italian!
0,Homer Simpson,"Fine, I'll never go back. Starting tomorrow. Today is Lenny's birthday and they're having ice cream cake."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Aw, them stinkin' liars."
5,Lisa Simpson,Night will come soon.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh... I was just thinking of a joke I saw on ""Herman's Head."""
0,Homer Simpson,"Then you visit your friend's game, and he's got this awesome candy mansion..."
11,Seymour Skinner,I certainly appreciate you helping us out with this field trip.
3,Bart Simpson,Pathetic. A kid who can't keep his parents' marriage together is no kid at all.
5,Lisa Simpson,What report?
5,Lisa Simpson,I don't want to turn out that way!
0,Homer Simpson,Don't you deserve better than the best?
5,Lisa Simpson,Bart will give back the Malibu Stacy head you thought was lost.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Mild?! There wasn't anything mild about it! Now get back to the pharmacy, you quack."
0,Homer Simpson,Billy Baldwin!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, it makes no sense. I haven't changed since high school and suddenly I'm uncool. I've been kicked out of paradise."
3,Bart Simpson,Daytime TV is muy estupido.
3,Bart Simpson,How 'bout the Disney Minority Program?
10,Krusty the Clown,"Princess, you're the only woman I care about enough to ditch at the altar."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, I guess this is it..."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Edna Krabappel, please report to the principal's arms."
5,Lisa Simpson,What's going on outside?
0,Homer Simpson,"Relax, I called her from the gas station."
1,Marge Simpson,Weren't you listening? I just told you a whole story about revenge.
5,Lisa Simpson,Peace on Earth.
1,Marge Simpson,It's so quiet here without the kids.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, this is for me."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I guess it'll have to be in Bart's room. And I thought when Homer cut off his thumb was bad."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh noW, we're into the dregs. Here's Ralph Wiggum's entry."
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, you've met my parents."
1,Marge Simpson,"I don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up."
5,Lisa Simpson,ARTS ARTS ARTS EDUCATION...
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, glad to hear you say that -- because the person who doesn't believe in zombies is always the first to get feasted upon."
10,Krusty the Clown,Did you hear about the blonde who couldn't make ice? She lost the recipe!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, Bart, stop it!"
0,Homer Simpson,"You see, Ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil."
0,Homer Simpson,Now get out of my house.
0,Homer Simpson,And when is this weekend?
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh yeah? My dear Lisa, you are eight and I am ten. And in my two extra years on this planet, I've learned a few tricks. Gimme that sax!"
0,Homer Simpson,Flat tire? No problem!
9,Moe Szyslak,His clowning around is putting me at ease.
1,Marge Simpson,"Hey, my husband makes good money, and we can certainly afford..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I don't like this movie. Can we go home?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, you're his father. You've got to try and reason with him."
0,Homer Simpson,Flanders! You gotta help me!
9,Moe Szyslak,Just move the pedals!
5,Lisa Simpson,I don't think Dad is accurately portraying Native American life.
1,Marge Simpson,I'm so sorry. How can I ever make this up to you?
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, Pierce Brosnan. A voice like his would give our house a much-needed touch of class."
5,Lisa Simpson,I've got to find that sound.
0,Homer Simpson,"Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right."
0,Homer Simpson,The ballet? Woo hoo!
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, how could you do this to me?"
0,Homer Simpson,How the hell did they find that out?
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, they can't fire me."
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, ere's what makes art valuable: 1. Nudity. 2. Holograms. 3. Something terrible happening to Jesus."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, I'm not gonna get fired. Is there any gold in this mountain?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, whatever you say, you know you will always have my love and respect."
0,Homer Simpson,She likes you! Put in a good word for grape.
0,Homer Simpson,Fine. Keep 'em. But you have to give back... Lisa?!
1,Marge Simpson,Now come on... You can play your little tie-up game inside. I've got some cocoa on the stove. Who wants imitation marshmallows?
0,Homer Simpson,Help me guys! Guys?
3,Bart Simpson,"You sure look stupid in that green dress, Lis."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Nice work, K-9s. Bring in the next group!"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Oh. Well, that makes sense. What'll they think of next? Blue pages?"
0,Homer Simpson,And it still works!
10,Krusty the Clown,Would you do my kid's birthday party?
5,Lisa Simpson,Is anything wrong?
0,Homer Simpson,Oh McGrew. Once again you've mistaken something for something!
0,Homer Simpson,"Actually, Dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, maybe if you enjoyed me more, I wouldn't be so screwed up."
8,Ned Flanders,What did the aliens look like?
3,Bart Simpson,I'll pay! How much?
0,Homer Simpson,I'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.
0,Homer Simpson,But I'll just draw bunny faces on them to scare Maggie away.
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well Edna, for a school with no Asian kids, I think we put on a pretty darn good science fair."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh well... we lost the money, but at least we've still got each other."
0,Homer Simpson,"Mr. Burns, I, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars."
3,Bart Simpson,Table for one.
1,Marge Simpson,"That's it, three stories. That's what we always tell."
0,Homer Simpson,Eat your broccoli.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Great! But from now on, we have to be totally honest with each other."
0,Homer Simpson,Mr. Power.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, I missed you guys too. Now if you'll excuse me..."
1,Marge Simpson,"I know how you like 'em, Homer."
3,Bart Simpson,"Aw jeez, I hope no one heard you say that."
9,Moe Szyslak,"That's right, she's into puppets."
0,Homer Simpson,"I don't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled, but I feel great."
0,Homer Simpson,"Mmmm, split-pea."
0,Homer Simpson,Two hundred dollars!
0,Homer Simpson,"Outta my way, you God-fearing Buckleheads!"
0,Homer Simpson,"I mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!"
0,Homer Simpson,I RECOMMEND / OUR DEAR OLD FRIEND / BARTENDER MOE SZYSLAK!

10,Krusty the Clown,"When Lorne asked me to host this show, I said Lorne, why me? I mean, I did just star in my first movie with Marvin Hagler and Tovah Borgnine. Yeah! Anyway. We got a great show for you. Well actually, the last half hour is a real garbage dump. Uh... we'll be right back."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Is it my religion? 'Cause I am a snake handler, but not an observant one. If we have kids, they just have to have a ceremony with a cobra by age three so grandfather will be happy."
1,Marge Simpson,Live from New York it's Saturday Night!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Please, Abe, let me buy you dinner in exchange for a few tales of the golden age of professional grappling."

0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, don't give up, Moe. The girl of your dreams has gotta be in some bar."
1,Marge Simpson,I don't know. Remember that New Year's Eve at Lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!
0,Homer Simpson,"Mmm, melon collie."
1,Marge Simpson,Oh Homie. I'm so sorry.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Groundskeeper Willie, you know the guy in the skirt? He bought himself a mail-order bride, but he was too cheap to pay the C.O.D., right? So she's still in a crate down at the post office! Wanna go look-see?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"And that's that. Another story in the classic, infallible three-act structure. Good enough for Aristotle, good enough for the Simpsons."
1,Marge Simpson,"My poor Lisa. If you can't make a leap of faith now and then, well... I feel sorry for you."
1,Marge Simpson,I don't see the safe zone anywhere.

6,Grampa Simpson,"Aw, who needs her? Now I'll have more time to read things I find on the ground. ""Lay-tex Con-do..."" Boy, I'd like to live in one of those."
0,Homer Simpson,It does!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Hurry up, Bart!"
11,Seymour Skinner,Certainly not I. It would change the way my suits fit.
5,Lisa Simpson,Do you think they'll be okay?
0,Homer Simpson,And another thing: If I ev...
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I was thinking more like drapes and a paint job, but your idea's good too."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hello, Smiley Face. Hello, Smiley Face."

0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoo hoo hoo! I did it!
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, ""Vegas Mom,"" how long are you gonna stay here?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Check it out, Dad. I rented all your favorite gorilla movies. ""Gorilla Squadron,"" ""Gorilla Island VI,""..."
8,Ned Flanders,"Aw, Maude. Your dead grandmother's pajamas. You know what that does to me."
3,Bart Simpson,You were just Barlow's lackey!
3,Bart Simpson,I can't believe I lost.
3,Bart Simpson,"You think you're so big 'cause your class always gets to do projects. Well, um... I'm doing a school project on, uh, fireworks!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Maybe a different outfit would make me look thinner.
0,Homer Simpson,Confederate degenerate?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for."
0,Homer Simpson,That could be Bart!
1,Marge Simpson,I was just trying to do the right thing! Who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, okay calm down. They couldn't have gone too far."
0,Homer Simpson,Denny's.
0,Homer Simpson,Twenty dollars?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Uh-oh, here he comes. Now this won't be easy, but pretend I'm a jerk."
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, I wish this world would evolve a few more kids like you, Lisa."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, good, Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back. He has to push the sanctity of marriage or his God will punish him."
8,Ned Flanders,"Well sir, that's very encouraging but I can't date a movie star. I'm no Arthur Miller or Lyle Lovett."
5,Lisa Simpson,So why steal the yogurt? We have to find out what they're up to.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, where have you been? I was so worried."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No it doesn't! This movie is drivel! She's wooden and unpleasant, and no matter what he does, he's still Ryan O'Neal."
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't have a stereotypical view of me just because I'm your mother. I know. How about we play the basketball? I'm no Harvey Globetrotter, but..."
6,Grampa Simpson,Now it's gonna show us exactly where to dig!

3,Bart Simpson,Getting higher and higher...
11,Seymour Skinner,They don't even know that my pockets are full of bottled water and cornbread!
3,Bart Simpson,You think you're better than the Great Simpsini?!
1,Marge Simpson,Patty! Selma! We're home.
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, you're a genius."
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, I'll take it from here, Ralph. Umm, we're just hangin', chillin'... little bit of illin'."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't. That saxophone was my one creative outlet. It was the only way I could truly express myself."
0,Homer Simpson,We can all burn evidence in it.
3,Bart Simpson,Just give me the cash and you'll get your drivers license back.
3,Bart Simpson,"And Dad, you look totally classy. You could be Abe Lincoln's father's boss!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, that's the third game in a row he cost us, Homer!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, you brought us to this horrible place on purpose?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Let's have the next child.
7,Chief Wiggum,But she broke the law.
3,Bart Simpson,There it is -- Wolfcastle's movie set.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Perhaps, but this monkey skeleton is in love."
0,Homer Simpson,"Out, boy, out."

3,Bart Simpson,This product is unbelievable!
10,Krusty the Clown,A new agent? I better freshen up.
3,Bart Simpson,"Dad, you can't let him take our dog!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, I'm not done dancin'! This bulletin better swing!"

0,Homer Simpson,"Ah! What does the ""I"" stand for again?"

0,Homer Simpson,"Bart, take the controls!"
5,Lisa Simpson,If they're anybody's children they're mine!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,...coin at a time.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh Dad, I never knew you had dreams, or emotions."
9,Moe Szyslak,"I'm sorry, kid. Sorry. I'm not used to the laughter of children. It cuts through me like a dentist's drill. But no, no, that was funny, that was funny, takin' away my dignity like that. Ha ha ha."
8,Ned Flanders,I was just telling him how brave he is to worship a false god.
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, that'll be way more fun than Vegas."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Not so fast, Simpson."
1,Marge Simpson,"Ohh, you want more syrup, honey?"
6,Grampa Simpson,GIMME THAT OLD TIME FUN / GIMME THAT OLD TIME FUN / GIMME THAT OLD TIME FUN / THE KIND WHERE WE STAY HOME...
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, I'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
11,Seymour Skinner,That's called a hose lengthener.
1,Marge Simpson,Uh... a blender cozy.
5,Lisa Simpson,"I LOVE NPR, AND JAZZ GUITAR..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Most of the money went to convincing them that I was ""alive."""
0,Homer Simpson,"I liked the producing, the executive producing and especially the co-producing. But the supervising producing was the best I've ever seen."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me."
11,Seymour Skinner,Hmf. Here's your bond issue.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Not for one Chinese second! And I'm sure she's forgotten all about me.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh no no, she says lots of words. Like when she wants something, she says"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't want to hear your whining. I'm a bored and joyless old man, give me a laugh!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Y'ello. You want my opinion on current movies?! Well, first of all, they're all perfect. Also: when's the Cap'n Crunch movie coming out? And will it be ""R"" or ""Hard R""?"
5,Lisa Simpson,I don't remember doing that. I would never cheat!
0,Homer Simpson,Stupid fingers.
0,Homer Simpson,Something else happened in that quarry... something... else...
7,Chief Wiggum,"No, no, no, no dice. All right, chimey, this time, the bell tolls for thee."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh c'mon, Marge. It's not fair to compare us to an American household."
3,Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, do you see what's on Channel six?"
10,Krusty the Clown,Those are tires from my ill-fated Krusty Town Car. It would explode if people gripped the wheel too tightly.
3,Bart Simpson,"So in a way, we'd just be balancing out the universe."
11,Seymour Skinner,Truly these band books deserve to be banned.
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, Apu. Some day you'll meet someone you really love."
1,Marge Simpson,"No I don't! What I mean is, to me you're just a stranger pretending to be something he's not."
0,Homer Simpson,"She's no Liza, but it works."
0,Homer Simpson,"Save me, Mr. X! Wait, I'm Mr. X."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Who cares? You're goin' out with me. She's going out with me, cat!"
3,Bart Simpson,Lisa.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back."
1,Marge Simpson,Then all that's left is to protect Maggie from the sun.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, McGarnigal, Billy is dead. They slit his throat from ear to ear."

9,Moe Szyslak,"All right, all right, good point. But, uh, let's hear from Angel Moe."
0,Homer Simpson,What a rotten day!
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, gimme a break, Marge."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Sorry, Ralph. That would defeat the purpose of testing as a means of student evaluation."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Look, if you all want to squeeze into the back seat, fine. With my box kite."
0,Homer Simpson,Hey Moe... I'll take care of the bar. You did me a favor today.
3,Bart Simpson,"Lis, that place is great! They have a jukebox in the basement! And look at the trick they taught me!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Thank you. Give the bully an extra point.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Don't do it, Bart."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh hello, Lisa. We were just uh, discussing Vasco De Gama."
3,Bart Simpson,"Whoa, look at him roll."
5,Lisa Simpson,Where am I? This neighborhood is starting to look a little bit like... Sesame Street.
0,Homer Simpson,"I always say, a boy can learn more at an airport than he can at any school."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, you like kindness, right?"
0,Homer Simpson,Underdog! Don't you know anything?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Nah, that was for snacks. This time... it's not personal."
0,Homer Simpson,You'll never believe what happened. I fell asleep at the wheel and the truck drove here by itself.
0,Homer Simpson,Not to worry. I'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper.
0,Homer Simpson,I gotta go.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"No, he's out getting a spray-on tan. He comes back orange and stains the furniture -- the man's a walking creamsicle!"

11,Seymour Skinner,He skipped town.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Wait, wait, wait! Please, Dad. Do you even think I'm funny?"
0,Homer Simpson,Hello Maggie.
1,Marge Simpson,"I hate when I come here and the first word out of my mouth is Homer. But here we go. Again. Homer was converting our dollars to gyros... not the money, the sandwich..."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn."
0,Homer Simpson,"Good idea, Marge. My mind is going a mile a minute."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, according to Aristotle, drama contains six elements: plot, theme, character--"

0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I thank God every day you settled for me."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, the arena's in Olde Springfield."
3,Bart Simpson,Otto-man?
5,Lisa Simpson,Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
1,Marge Simpson,Homer! Don't you think you're spoiling...

10,Krusty the Clown,Who's your agent?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Just do it! Do it! Do it now!

0,Homer Simpson,"Well, what have we got?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Good work, Dad."
0,Homer Simpson,Yes. Thomas Edison smoked several cigars a day.

0,Homer Simpson,Championship?
1,Marge Simpson,Is he okay?
0,Homer Simpson,Ice cream truck!
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, you've got to learn that life isn't always fair. Try to channel your disappointment into something creative, like a sampler."

6,Grampa Simpson,"It may not be much, but it's all I've got."
3,Bart Simpson,Am I getting dumped?
1,Marge Simpson,"All right, I was trying to keep it from you, but I had a good reason. Every time you go to that cook-off, you get drunk as a poet on payday. Remember last year?"

7,Chief Wiggum,"Nah, no, not our lover boy. If I know his MO, he saved the biggest one for today."
0,Homer Simpson,Twenty-four hours?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"So, you've come begging not to be fired? Smithers, turn my back on this man. Maximum huff!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Grampa!
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, Homer, when I found out about this I went through a wide range of emotions. First I was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. But now I realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do."
0,Homer Simpson,"She sure did. Now if Lisa is finished with her shenanigans, I'll tell you why I didn't show up..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, we have plenty of supplies to get through tomorrow. And then a wave of disease should help to -- hey!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, rescue you, stuff myself with candy... It's all good."
1,Marge Simpson,I'm not a hoarder! Do the Yankees hoard pennants? Does Marrakesh hoard intrigue?
0,Homer Simpson,"Here we are, Maggie. That park you love..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, honey, if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow, we'll do something special, just for you."
0,Homer Simpson,"They're just drones, Lisa. They only live for like five minutes anyway. And they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and Bart."
3,Bart Simpson,"Can I have a burger, dad?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Relax, we're just looky-loos. We're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors."
0,Homer Simpson,No! Remember your hippopotamus oath.
1,Marge Simpson,YOU LIKE POTATO...
5,Lisa Simpson,How did you get tickets?
0,Homer Simpson,Then what are you dressed like that for?
1,Marge Simpson,"Now, I'm off to a party, my outfit is chic. It's a Catwoman costume I'm sure is unique."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Uh, give me your lunch money."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh sure. Last resort... Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. Everyone's agin me. I'll do it."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.
0,Homer Simpson,And do you love lasagna... like me?
3,Bart Simpson,"Wendy Windbag? ""Ugly Doris""? ""Hortense: The Mule-faced Doll""?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, if I'm gonna be a real hippie, I have to learn from the master, Mr. Bob ""flower child"" Hope."
6,Grampa Simpson,And then there was the time I taught a dog to make oatmeal...
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, no, no, no, no, no... ah, perfect!"
1,Marge Simpson,...and then I saw my boy in a burlap sack and they told me he had lice!
0,Homer Simpson,Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Our Lord, Buddha, says the secret of existence is to pass beyond fear."
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, Lisa, I know you miss your whale. So I got you a pet that will never die. An invisible dog."
0,Homer Simpson,"Dirty trick. Okay, I'm not gonna kill you, but I'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. You ruined your father. You've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary."
0,Homer Simpson,Hmm... This doesn't look so bad.
0,Homer Simpson,Nice meetin' ya! Just keep moving. Don't make eye contact.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, Marge. He'll knock your block off. Your beautiful block."
1,Marge Simpson,"Goodbye, Homie. Here's Dr. Hibbert's number if you feel weak."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, a real Candyland! Of the mind, the mind. I'll just go now."
0,Homer Simpson,Hello! Hello? Anybody home? Hello?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, it wouldn't be you if you didn't say ""excellent."""

1,Marge Simpson,Welcome to Pretzel Wagon. May I take your order?
3,Bart Simpson,All he does is lie there like an unemployed whale.
0,Homer Simpson,Uh-huh... uh-huh...
5,Lisa Simpson,"...And we'd be doing our part for the environment! Plus, we'd get to clean up all those cute animals."
1,Marge Simpson,"Yes, we'll go to the darn lake! Now go back to bed. It's four A.M.!"
0,Homer Simpson,"MISTER, WE COULD USE A MAN LIKE SHERIFF LOBO AGAIN."
9,Moe Szyslak,"That guy just don't get it, do he?"
8,Ned Flanders,You just fetch it!
1,Marge Simpson,My spine is not a scratching post!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, both groups claim their intentions are noble, but at the end of the day, they're both trying to steal as much money as they can."
0,Homer Simpson,"Why the hell would he want to do that... blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich? I like your hat, sweetie."
11,Seymour Skinner,"That stone is coming in like a rocket! It's gotta be going four, maybe five miles an hour!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Buy the Police Department a hang-glider, you said. Fight crime from above, you said."
0,Homer Simpson,You ain't pretty no more!
3,Bart Simpson,What makes you think that?
0,Homer Simpson,Wee!
5,Lisa Simpson,"C'mon, guys. I had to get rid of Bart."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I'm watching a rerun of an important Bowl game."
8,Ned Flanders,"Heh-heh, yeah."
0,Homer Simpson,Only one hundred percent?
8,Ned Flanders,"Tell you what -- if we turn around, it'll feel like we're at the front of the line!"
0,Homer Simpson,I'm going back to the stadium to bring those two kids back together. And I'll do it with or without you!
1,Marge Simpson,P.U.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, kids! Who do you love?"
0,Homer Simpson,What a nice lady.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, look at that show-off... kissing his own muscles. Boo!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, I don't think Lenny's house has a steeple."
3,Bart Simpson,I never wanted her to get fired.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Jimmy!
0,Homer Simpson,"What the hell is a ""fundae""?"
0,Homer Simpson,Because humans are obnoxious sometimes. Humans hate things.
7,Chief Wiggum,"That's exactly what I'm saying, Decapitating Harry. Now move it."
3,Bart Simpson,"You know, Grampa kinda smells like that trunk in the garage where the bottom's all wet."
0,Homer Simpson,Professional athletes. Always wantin' more.
0,Homer Simpson,Use both hands...
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends."
1,Marge Simpson,BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN MY EYES WILL SOON BE TURNING RED...
0,Homer Simpson,"Ahhh, you can really taste the goat."
1,Marge Simpson,What do you recommend?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Lisa Simpson, you have just been transferred to the Springfield magnet school for the gifted and troublesome. Please climb into the idling bus."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh sorry, Dad. Our blog is so popular, we got an invitation to the most exclusive restaurant in town. Kent Brockman himself could only get a reservation at five-thirty or nine-thirty!"
1,Marge Simpson,"All right, kids, you don't have to go. But I insist we do something tonight as a family. We'll play board games, put photos in an album, measure how much you've grown..."
0,Homer Simpson,"I guess this is it. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die a man."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"That's exactly the poi-- Oh, Simpson, can't you go five seconds without humiliating yourself?"
0,Homer Simpson,Thank God I'm not in the shower!
3,Bart Simpson,"I wanna thank everyone for this special night. Jazz folk may have the smallest apartments, but they also have the biggest hearts."
0,Homer Simpson,Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?
1,Marge Simpson,Sure as sugar.
8,Ned Flanders,I'm afraid you can't live here.
1,Marge Simpson,Nobody will ever cut me off again!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, baby. Remember me?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Mmm, this sugar shark is delicious."
3,Bart Simpson,Yeah. Ahhh!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, what can I do? They won't let me in the boys' school."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, you do have to use your imagination. Look, there's the Three Wise Men."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Lisa's right. You're the only one who hasn't cried about the dog."
0,Homer Simpson,"Bup, no fighting, boys."
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, Skinner, you're the best kid-man in the business. You've read their notes, searched their lockers -- you know how tweens think."
3,Bart Simpson,LISA EATS BU-UGS...
7,Chief Wiggum,"Gee, I'd hate to close you down. Maybe we can reach a little, ah, ""understanding"" here..."
7,Chief Wiggum,Aww. Lookit that.
3,Bart Simpson,Phew!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well I couldn't get a hold of him. No cell phone. But if I know Bart, he's busy doing something awesome."
5,Lisa Simpson,That's my brother.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, maybe the internet has the information I need! It certainly answered a lot of my questions about wang enhancement."
0,Homer Simpson,That makes sense. Movin' on.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Uh, that's a parasol."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, Dad. I'm gonna make a human yo-yo. If you object, clearly say ""no""."
3,Bart Simpson,"Ohh, oh, got him."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's our address."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I don't care if they think you're a coward, Dad. You did the right thing, hiding and crying."
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay Mom, for you, I'll try."
8,Ned Flanders,And she's teleconferencing the Devil using that computer from Hell!
0,Homer Simpson,I can't believe Marge hasn't called me. Maybe I should go home.
0,Homer Simpson,I win!
3,Bart Simpson,I'm comin'!
8,Ned Flanders,What the dickens?!
11,Seymour Skinner,"No thanks, gentlemen, I've got a nice quiet life here, and I mean to keep it that way."
3,Bart Simpson,Nothing you say can upset us. We're the MTV generation.
5,Lisa Simpson,Wow! This is the best anniversary ever.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Would you say he's the ultimate superhero?
0,Homer Simpson,Then I'll do it!
0,Homer Simpson,"You think you've got problems, look what I just pulled out of my arm!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Here's your lunches. With some cake. You'll be having cake for a long, long, time."
5,Lisa Simpson,And there weren't any Jewish cowboys.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hurry up, Dad!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, y'know, business stuff... downsizing, e-solutions, the glass ceiling..."
3,Bart Simpson,Wow! I wish I had an elephant.
9,Moe Szyslak,You got that right!
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, not really... 'cause yours is just a piece of extension cord..."
0,Homer Simpson,Attention everyone in Iceland! We have an important announcement!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, there's extensive cauliflowering."
8,Ned Flanders,I -- I think I hate Homer Simpson.
1,Marge Simpson,"Here's what I would do... in the middle of the night, clean Bart's room for him, then in the morning thank him for cleaning his room."
0,Homer Simpson,Come on... you... stupid... car... you... get... goin'...
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, Stampy. I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer."

0,Homer Simpson,"Patent pending... Patent pending... Patent pending... Hey, who's this guy?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, I guess you learned your lesson, so now I'll untie ya."
3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, Greta, it's me. I think you left your pencil over at my house and he's there now, isn't he?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"It's classic mirth-making, is what it is."
5,Lisa Simpson,His company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents! He changed the way Hollywood drives!
0,Homer Simpson,You know what your problem is? You haven't become as bad as the people we chase!
0,Homer Simpson,The Simpsons are off the grid! And so far it's going great!
0,Homer Simpson,Laxative?
3,Bart Simpson,And it's on this DVD!
8,Ned Flanders,"It's gonna be one wholesome evening. So, do you think Marge could take care of rowdy Roddy and Typhoon Todd?"
0,Homer Simpson,I met a guy. A wonderful guy.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Wake up, Dad! Wake up! There was a burglar and he took my saxophone."
0,Homer Simpson,Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid.
11,Seymour Skinner,Men. The room for me!
7,Chief Wiggum,"I don't want to censor myself, that's how creativity dies."

8,Ned Flanders,"Okely, dokely do!"
0,Homer Simpson,His name is Ned!
9,Moe Szyslak,"No, no, don't try to stop me."

3,Bart Simpson,What do you mean it's over?
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, really..."
8,Ned Flanders,"Lord, this town may have turned its back on you, but not the Flanderses. Wherever we are, you'll have your church. Are you with me, boys?"
0,Homer Simpson,Lousy two-legged pants.
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question: why would a man whose shirt says ""Genius At Work"" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Faster, Marge! Faster! The snapping turtles are massing!"
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, all right, um, your ankle goes there..."
3,Bart Simpson,Told ya.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well in that case, Lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so I opened the drapes to let in more sun."
0,Homer Simpson,"So kids, its Valentine's Day, and you know what that means -- you get to stay downstairs watching TV with the sound turned way up."
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Burns, but you can't have these dogs. Am I fired?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Poke the monster with a stick! Tuppence a jab! C'mon, queue up, lads."

10,Krusty the Clown,Hey hey. Hey hey. Hey hey.
3,Bart Simpson,Lethal inject her on the electric chair!
11,Seymour Skinner,"Bart, eyewitnesses to your fight described you as ""berserkoid,"" ""totally aggro,"" and said you punched Milhouse ""like fifty billion times."" That's an excessive number of times."
0,Homer Simpson,"Screw you, doc! I fly from the gut."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ouch, this place is fancy."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Ah, Homer, what am I gonna do? Renee's my last chance for true love."

1,Marge Simpson,Umm... How about... Ghostmutt?
0,Homer Simpson,"Shrink ray? Oh, there's always something else to buy."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't hand out candy, you son of a Gritch."
6,Grampa Simpson,What are you cryin' about?
1,Marge Simpson,"Listen, sweetie... it was wrong of me to force my dreams on you."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Drop the cone, Sugar."
3,Bart Simpson,"They'd work much better without the padding, Doc."
6,Grampa Simpson,I like the way you Italians think.
0,Homer Simpson,I don't know guys. I'm not sure I'm feeling this. The bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, um, I'm kind of lost. Can you tell me where I am?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Get out here, boy! I wanna punish you before I get drunk and merciful!"

3,Bart Simpson,"Well, now that hypnotist is gonna come back and snap him out of it!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Where are you, kids?"
0,Homer Simpson,Uh... yes sir. I thought I was supposed to.
0,Homer Simpson,Lucky.
1,Marge Simpson,"Yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and I don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon."
5,Lisa Simpson,This is a valuable skill. People might even pay you to build things for them.
3,Bart Simpson,Check it out -- that frog has a nerd on its butt!
0,Homer Simpson,"Why you little... oh, hi Jesus. I was just..."
0,Homer Simpson,"I was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of Chad Sexington. Do you mind?"
8,Ned Flanders,Dang!
7,Chief Wiggum,"I'm sorry, Homer. If I hadn't been so needy, we wouldn't be in this trunk."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, son. Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian."
8,Ned Flanders,Funyuns?! Little Debbies?!
9,Moe Szyslak,I was in Tuscaloosa on vacation. It started out great. They got a jernt there called Moe's Original Barbecue.
1,Marge Simpson,Enough with the singing!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, could you keep it down a little? I'm trying to study."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, honey, don't be so naive. That's how the world works. Sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yah! Oh, cool, it must be dislocated or something..."
3,Bart Simpson,I showed it to your friends again before we left.
3,Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, this isn't you."

8,Ned Flanders,"Hey Homer, why the sour puss? Didja chugalug a skunky Snapple?"
3,Bart Simpson,I thought it was chocolate milk!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Well, Homer's out. We gotta find a new General Ambrose Burnside."
0,Homer Simpson,Wait a minute...
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, this doesn't work any more."
3,Bart Simpson,They might not be dead -- they could be in the basement!
5,Lisa Simpson,I don't understand it. We're always the ones who solve these problems.
8,Ned Flanders,That's the plug for the light!
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, it's your bedtime. I laid out your jammy-jams."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I was always cheering for you, Grampa. Till now."
0,Homer Simpson,"If you fire me, I'll call President Sarkozy and he'll be all over you like Truffaut on Hitchcock."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, your behavior is heinous."

0,Homer Simpson,Why you little... I'll teach you to have a libido!
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't make a fuss over me, boys. Just pour me a beer in a clean glass."

3,Bart Simpson,When did he lose his cuteness?
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, Lisa, we're ready for your centerpiece!"
1,Marge Simpson,"They do make my neck look thinner... Oh, all right, let's do it."
0,Homer Simpson,"Eh, it'll turn up somewhere."
5,Lisa Simpson,And I will make thee a hat from construction paper!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Nah. Nah. Just, uh, hop that fence, sneak up and, uh, peek in the window there."
9,Moe Szyslak,"My Professor said if I prettied up this dump, it would renew my zeal."
0,Homer Simpson,"No, son, we both won. You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special."
0,Homer Simpson,THOSE CATS WERE FAST AS LIGHTNING...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, is Dad stealing from people he's supposed to help?"
0,Homer Simpson,And only one of you kids can go to college.

7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, you too."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Wait, Homer! Don't go."

9,Moe Szyslak,"Listen to those lucky people, enjoying that pretty flower. I got nothin' -- just this can."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey lame ass. Thanks to you, we're stuck on a stupid therapy boat."
8,Ned Flanders,"And, of course, I resist all the major urges."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wow, TV's Kent Brockman."
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry, you'll grow into it."
8,Ned Flanders,"I hate to be a bossy Betty, but I have to forbid you to eat its fruit."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Yeah, we lived here till the bank foreclosed in sixty-three. Farm went bust after the cows started givin' sour milk. Somethin' musta spooked 'em good."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, everybody trusts Lisa. Precious little Lisa, apple of her Daddy's eye."
1,Marge Simpson,"Heyyy, look at that."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I'm your cellmate. You never noticed me, because, frankly, you're extremely self-centered."
3,Bart Simpson,What a lame-o!
5,Lisa Simpson,You're finished already? But the competition isn't for weeks.
3,Bart Simpson,I've always done it. Just like I only eat the eyes off a lobster.
1,Marge Simpson,"I wouldn't bother him, honey. He's making some kind of model for a contest. He says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand."
0,Homer Simpson,Cars shaped like cupcakes!
0,Homer Simpson,Are you Kavi?
0,Homer Simpson,"Look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. These guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college."
6,Grampa Simpson,Burn him!
1,Marge Simpson,"God, that Junior League burns me up."

9,Moe Szyslak,"Aw geez, I am no good at weddings. I am no good at weddings."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Aw, I miss him, too, the big fat dickens. Hey, Bea, I've got to ask you, what was death like?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh. Design your own power plant, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am."
0,Homer Simpson,"I think they killed each other. You know, one of those murder-suicide deals."

5,Lisa Simpson,Bart?! Shouldn't you be in class?
1,Marge Simpson,Apu thinks we can get the money -- at the casino playing blackjack.
0,Homer Simpson,I don't know. It's a lot of pressure. Do many people watch the Super Bowl?

0,Homer Simpson,"Fine, whatever."
0,Homer Simpson,Directory assistance?

0,Homer Simpson,"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst."
3,Bart Simpson,Christmas Eve. The one night a kid wants to go to sleep is the one night he can't. I can't have another cocoa.

1,Marge Simpson,"Stop it, Homer!"
7,Chief Wiggum,"It's me, Clancy."
0,Homer Simpson,"A girl! Oh Marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! Not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Yeah! Fifty dollars up! Time to play with house money!
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't very well chop your hand off and bring it to the store, could I?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Daddy made it for your dance recital, honey!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't worry, Dad. We'll be dead in five minutes."
3,Bart Simpson,Eh. This song's a little bossy for me.
1,Marge Simpson,Eewww!!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, balderdash! It's not important how old you are on parchment, it's how old you feel in the humors."
0,Homer Simpson,It does look delicious.
5,Lisa Simpson,Change it! Change it!
0,Homer Simpson,"That's okay. I'll just push the button for the stimulator, I mean elevator."
3,Bart Simpson,"""I'll die before I surrender, Tim."" Who's Tim?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,I never liked that Dr. Stupid.
5,Lisa Simpson,How about town crier? You'd be great at that.
5,Lisa Simpson,I can't believe what I've done -- maybe deep down I always knew how much this film would hurt them. Maybe I'm the monster this movie exposed.
8,Ned Flanders,"Okilly-dokilly. Oo, I better go take down the manger scene. If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait a second. If I'd been Class President like I was supposed to, I'd be the one with the big mansion and the color TVs and the hot wife!"
3,Bart Simpson,The best performance of my life.
1,Marge Simpson,Homer!
7,Chief Wiggum,I don't know. Get some attention from a handsome police officer.
3,Bart Simpson,MyCube! Take me away!
10,Krusty the Clown,"I'm a sad, tragic clown like what's his name, Liberace."
0,Homer Simpson,Beer keg do-nut?
5,Lisa Simpson,"The answer is ""bonbon""!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, here goes. Bart, I have something for you!"
1,Marge Simpson,When did you start liking Thai food?
1,Marge Simpson,"Holy moly, we can't stay here. It's full of raccoons."
6,Grampa Simpson,The problem with Puerto Ricans is...
0,Homer Simpson,I love spying.
5,Lisa Simpson,Here are your lunches. And no trading your fruit for firecrackers.
1,Marge Simpson,"Maybe I'd better check mine. ""Today, your husband will die."" Homer, I'm scared."
1,Marge Simpson,It's like drinking e. e. cummings!
11,Seymour Skinner,"And they're set at a place kids relate to. Say, a school."
0,Homer Simpson,"Go Knightboat, go!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't shoot, Don't shoot. They're souvenirs."
1,Marge Simpson,"We've got to do something, but what?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's Hans Moleman."
0,Homer Simpson,Mmm... promo.
0,Homer Simpson,I got the idea when I noticed the refrigerator was cold.
10,Krusty the Clown,"It's just... I thought... seriously, it can be really tough to lose your father."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"So, tell me, are all you government inspectors so handsome and strapping?"
1,Marge Simpson,Got 'em.
11,Seymour Skinner,Attention everyone. This is Principal Skinner.
0,Homer Simpson,"... and our three children, Bart, Lisa and Maggie."
0,Homer Simpson,What the hell are you two...
0,Homer Simpson,Of course not. We'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
0,Homer Simpson,Woo hoo! A four day weekend!
1,Marge Simpson,Again? I was hoping you could spend some time with the kids.
1,Marge Simpson,I'll tell you what. We're going to Scottsdale!
1,Marge Simpson,Is it your impression of Mr. Burns eating soup? Because I'm not in the mood.
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooo, did I ever. And that herbal anger rinse just washed the rage right out of me."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,The Terrifying Callback!
0,Homer Simpson,"Whoa, you just blew my mind!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Krusty, this camp was a nightmare. They fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Oh, it's like that, huh? The minute you go undercover, you act like you don't know me. He'll turn on you too, Fat Tony -- you just wait."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, that's my pop up there! Dad watch out!"
0,Homer Simpson,A lot of that went in my lungs.
5,Lisa Simpson,Dunkilderry is so quaint! It looks like the puzzle at the pediatrician's office.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,This is gonna be great! A real rumble! Just like in that movie where the Jets fought the Sharks!
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, look who's here. You two are goin' down."
3,Bart Simpson,"It's dessert, but it's hot dogs, so it's good for you!"
0,Homer Simpson,Do I smell cookies? Where's the cookies?
1,Marge Simpson,"I do too. But it was sweet. Women really like that sort of thing, Homie."
0,Homer Simpson,"So what are you up to, young lady?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Come on TV... gimme some of that sweet, sweet pap!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Hey, watch out for the Shaq-attack!"
0,Homer Simpson,"So it's weird -- don't worry, I'll make it fun."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Careful children, that's my car."
0,Homer Simpson,"Change the channel, Marge."
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm a ""Star Wars."" Now let's see who you've drawn!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, wait a minute. There's no batteries in this thing."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... Maggie!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, how much did you just give that man?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm sorry. It's just that these tours are so exhausting. You're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing Marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, Bart. It's a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer. It's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Nelson, those don't count as Easter Eggs!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, Dad. How did you do that?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I don't know if I can. I'm a yo-yo dieter: ""Yo, hot dog man!"" ""Yo, peanuts!"" Why aren't you laughing? Don't you know what ""yo"" means?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, Lord."
3,Bart Simpson,But we didn't enter any police raffle.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Yeah, the only thing we're known for is leading the country in heart attacks."
0,Homer Simpson,"They have beer and gum, right?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"A dog! All right, Dad!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Did Gaga just say ""hurt everyone""?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. I also crush cars into cubes. And on the side, I promote local tough man contests. Basically I'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til I go to law school."
1,Marge Simpson,I think we should go see our mortgage broker.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh. Hee, hee. Sorry."
1,Marge Simpson,When I was a kid we didn't show our affection by head-butting.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"I'm telling you, I didn't do anything."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, what's with the skirt?"
9,Moe Szyslak,"--and I promise that I will hand-brew every bottle with these very hands, huh?"
6,Grampa Simpson,Lamp those gams! You were one nifty number!
3,Bart Simpson,Plead insanity! Plead insanity!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, cut that out! I have an idea."
1,Marge Simpson,"Look Maggie, I'm Wonder Woman."
1,Marge Simpson,Poor Ned. This is his first Jellyfish Festival alone.
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, don't worry. This'll give his heartstrings a much needed plucking."
0,Homer Simpson,You know I'm not Pie Man.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy."
0,Homer Simpson,Are you happy and full of life?
0,Homer Simpson,"C'mon, Lisa! The TV's been off for five whole minutes!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Stick your head out the window, boy. It's the greatest!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Cool! / Neat-o!
0,Homer Simpson,"Let's see. What Native American activities should we do? Making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the Civil War."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh good, here comes the collection plate."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Si. My grandmother, Nana Sophie, lives in Tuscany. Since I was a baby I've spent two weeks there every summer..."
0,Homer Simpson,"No I don't, I hate to rhyme."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,That's all I ever wanted.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Yes, he's in Geneva, chairing a conference on Nuclear Fission. Yes, that should stick."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,With no Sir Topham Hatt to tell us what we can and can't do!
1,Marge Simpson,"Enough! Stop! Christmas carols only have one verse! Well they may have more, but the second verse is where they get all weird and religiousy."
0,Homer Simpson,I'll audience you!
0,Homer Simpson,World's Biggest Pizza?!
0,Homer Simpson,Why you little...! Why you little...!
3,Bart Simpson,I hear Lou mooing in my head!
1,Marge Simpson,There it is -- ol' bounce 'n' giggle.
0,Homer Simpson,Go get Lassie.
3,Bart Simpson,Tons.
0,Homer Simpson,"Dear God of England: please let me go. In return I will spell the word ""color"" with a ""u"" and I'll use the metric system with every cubic milliliter of blood in my... oh, I can't do it. It's so stupid!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"According to this contract, we have to change his name to ""Suds McDuff."""
3,Bart Simpson,I'd give my brother everything I have! He could be the race car in Monopoly! Monopoly! The race car!
3,Bart Simpson,We don't have any dope.
3,Bart Simpson,How can you like that guy?
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey Dad, you remember when you said if Flanders got remarried you'd eat your hat?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Hi, honey. Where's that vicious dog? I made him a biscuit."
0,Homer Simpson,Why... you... little...!
0,Homer Simpson,"Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Those royal elephants have trainers to keep 'em in shape. Average schmoe like me, forget it."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Indoor plumbing. The lack of it killed my mother.
8,Ned Flanders,"""...lest I come and strike the earth with a curse."" Thus ends the book of Malachi. I guess I did know the whole Old Testament by heart. Out with the old... in with the new. Testament, that is. Matthew One. ""The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham..."""
0,Homer Simpson,Good idea.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, anyone would be nervous with all the economic turmoil you read about in the..."
0,Homer Simpson,We sure did... soul mate.
1,Marge Simpson,Just for standing on a thing?
3,Bart Simpson,"Thanks, Dad."
3,Bart Simpson,Is it too late to make you breakfast in bed?
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, what smells so good?"
0,Homer Simpson,Wasn't me.
9,Moe Szyslak,"Uh, well, your building will be fine, but unfortunately a lot of your merchandise was completely vaporized: high-end stereo equipment, size ten men's shoes..."
5,Lisa Simpson,Come on.
8,Ned Flanders,"Unmarried?! That's it, I'm turning 'em in."
3,Bart Simpson,Lemonade! Sweet sunshine in your mouth! Buy a cup or I punch my sister!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Come back here, you stinkin' -- Hey, I wonder how much air is in here."
3,Bart Simpson,Hey! Hey! That's a leave-in conditioner!
1,Marge Simpson,"Fine. If we're not going for a walk, we'll just talk about our day. I wrote another poem about a duck."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, brilliant. A cash settlement. I could have figured that out, you button-down maggot."
1,Marge Simpson,That's an awfully crowded classroom.
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, can we go to New York to find this girl I used to know?"
3,Bart Simpson,"What do you mean, the last one alive?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Aww, isn't that cute? He's trying to claw my eyes out."
1,Marge Simpson,Can I get you a glass of milk?
3,Bart Simpson,"Come on, Touch of death. Touch of death. Touch of death."
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, I can't wait to get my lips around an ice cold..."
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm worried about the kids, Homie. Lisa's becoming very obsessive. This morning I caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat."
1,Marge Simpson,"I got it halfway-- Oh, it went back."
3,Bart Simpson,That's no problem -- Mom can make garbage taste great.
9,Moe Szyslak,But then I heard their city anthem. Give a listen:
0,Homer Simpson,Only my hairdresser knows for sure.
3,Bart Simpson,Yeah. Whatever.
9,Moe Szyslak,I didn't want to have to do this...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, before our dad signs any contracts, he has a surprise for you..."
0,Homer Simpson,"It's okay -- we're not really your kids. We're just representations of them, that you created in your mind."
0,Homer Simpson,"""Releasing your inner screenplay,"" ""Create an online kennel,"" ooh, ""Strip for your wife!"""
9,Moe Szyslak,But everybody comes to Moe's.
8,Ned Flanders,Ow! My Flander-doodles!
1,Marge Simpson,Barney?
1,Marge Simpson,"I understand, honey. Did you get someone to cover?"
7,Chief Wiggum,"Yeah, they'll pass you around like... well, like currency, like you said. Maybe we can make you boys a deal."
3,Bart Simpson,Umm... there's a ladybug in your hair.
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Uh, you want this?"
7,Chief Wiggum,Let me ask you this. Shut up.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I think Maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing ""Baby Must-Have."""
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Can I come? Every vandalism spree needs an obnoxious laugher.
1,Marge Simpson,But the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound.
0,Homer Simpson,Fish out of water!
0,Homer Simpson,"Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this."
3,Bart Simpson,Is that true?
0,Homer Simpson,So what? Mr. Burns is dead.
3,Bart Simpson,"Don't listen to 'em, D. Just remember, you've got a new persona. A new per-so-na."
0,Homer Simpson,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh..."
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Try-a the cheese-a pizza. It's greasy like-a you.
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I am a married man..."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, we made a terrible, terrible mistake. Uh... won't happen again."
3,Bart Simpson,I am going off to explore the Crevices of Lagrimmar.
9,Moe Szyslak,Who wants a bathtub mint julep?
5,Lisa Simpson,I can't keep sleeping in Mom and Dad's room.
5,Lisa Simpson,I did? How?
1,Marge Simpson,"Bart, get out!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Uh, hey, how ya doin'?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey Moe, got any milk?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, no, what have I done? I smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? A few measly cents. Not even enough to buy one beer. Wait a minute, lemme count and make sure..."
10,Krusty the Clown,...and so utterly repellant he...
5,Lisa Simpson,Bart! There's no such thing as first bedsies. You just made that up.
5,Lisa Simpson,Does Bart have to be there?
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe, my in-laws are coming. I need something strong enough that I forget I hate them, but not so strong that I tell them I love them."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, my audition is in half..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Don't worry, Bart, they won't bother you anymore."
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah, it's like looking down a Canadian tunnel."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa? Is this what I've come to? Fighting over a stupid sandwich on my daughter's big day? Mister, I'll take that car."
5,Lisa Simpson,Like that old woman who couldn't find the beef?
0,Homer Simpson,Where's that kid with my latte?!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ow, that hurt."
0,Homer Simpson,"Right, right. But will it happen this time?"
1,Marge Simpson,"""Burly Paper Towels, Burlyville, Minnesota. Dear Sir or Madam: Your paper towel packets promised a hundred and two sheets of towels. But I was blessed to receive one hundred and three. I'm returning the extra towel, unused..."""
0,Homer Simpson,"This is for you, son."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I feel like I'm gonna die, Bart."
5,Lisa Simpson,It always comes down to trans-substantiation versus con-substantiation.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Gah! Oh, hello, Mater. Uh... Sorry about pulling the plug on you and all. Who could've known you'd pull through and... live for another five decades? Oh, is my face red..."
0,Homer Simpson,"No, no! Not like that! Like this!"
0,Homer Simpson,Here you go. Front and center.
3,Bart Simpson,But... But I wasn't...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hmm, well, they are good ones."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Splendid, Lisa. By far the best presentation of the day!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Great news, everyone. Goliath is dead! Although I haven't seen his body, the blast that failed to kill me, surely killed the giant. Anyhoo, now that I'm your king again..."
6,Grampa Simpson,I had to take care of his hounds for a year.
3,Bart Simpson,"""His,"" eh? Hmm, so it's a dude."
5,Lisa Simpson,Why don't you be the quizmaster and ask other people the questions?
5,Lisa Simpson,Shut your mouth!
5,Lisa Simpson,Can I make an observation?
8,Ned Flanders,We have to do everything by the book.
5,Lisa Simpson,That's one small step f-- Whoa!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Actually, bees rarely sting when they're in a cluster. They only attack to defend their hive."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, let's all hug Apu."
0,Homer Simpson,"Apu, you shoulda seen your face when they showed you those babies."
0,Homer Simpson,Then get married. What the hell do you want from me?!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Oh, Lisa..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Wait, kids. You can't give up on Itchy and Scratchy. You're always so good at these things. Why, together you've reunited Krusty with his father, gotten Principal Skinner his job back, and helped Dr. Riviera perform open-heart surgery on your father. You've even foiled Sideshow Bob on five separate occasions, and he's an evil genius."
5,Lisa Simpson,I made it!
6,Grampa Simpson,He wrote a memoir.
3,Bart Simpson,Yeah. Shut my mouth and let your boss win.
1,Marge Simpson,"You know, I saw Apu today. He's really frazzled."
0,Homer Simpson,Moe! Don't throw out that brine!
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, right after dinner, it's down to business."
0,Homer Simpson,There's no future in that!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,It was.
0,Homer Simpson,"And ""Otto"" is ""Otto"" backwards."
5,Lisa Simpson,How could this have happened? I feel so dirty. Uh.. uh...uh. The dirt's not coming off. Okay. Calm down. This must just be a little typo.
6,Grampa Simpson,You don't care what happens to me when I die.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Find the bathroom alright?
0,Homer Simpson,Wah neh! Wah neh!
3,Bart Simpson,"Sky, sky, sky with building, grass, grass with foot."
3,Bart Simpson,"You've always been there for me, man. I'll never turn my back on you again."
0,Homer Simpson,"Heh, still got it..."
1,Marge Simpson,I thought you were playing catch with Artie.
0,Homer Simpson,Aw...
1,Marge Simpson,But they let me take fabric samples!
5,Lisa Simpson,What the heck's going on?
1,Marge Simpson,I'm Bart Simpson's mother. You think you've got any tricks I haven't seen?
6,Grampa Simpson,Maybe so... but I know how to play possum!
3,Bart Simpson,"Trust me, that is a valuable card. Pick up another."
1,Marge Simpson,They came in one at a time.
0,Homer Simpson,"Gold bars discovered by Marge? Zero. Gold bars discovered by Homer? Well, let's just see..."
5,Lisa Simpson,I was so bored!
1,Marge Simpson,"Grampa, could you do something?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Please don't say a man.
5,Lisa Simpson,"It's not really avenging her, Dad. Just the fulfillment of her last wish."
0,Homer Simpson,"So ""if"" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be ""deadlocked"" and have to be ""sequestered"" in the Springfield Palace Hotel."
0,Homer Simpson,"Me. / Right here. / Oh, me too. / Please."
0,Homer Simpson,Yeah... think about it.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Come on in. Dignity's on me, friends."
1,Marge Simpson,I'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Then you got these ""lady"" comics talkin' about stuff that would embarrass Redd Foxx, God rest his smutty soul. Who they slept with, what time they sit on the can... This is supposed to get you a husband?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Boys, I'd like your attention, please."
0,Homer Simpson,"Moe, can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with ""f""?"
1,Marge Simpson,That one creeps me out from the beginning.
3,Bart Simpson,It must be a make-your-own sundae bar!
3,Bart Simpson,"And if he runs away, he'll be easy to catch."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No. But you did do something. You made me love baseball. Not as a collection of numbers, but as an unpredictable, passionate game beaten in excitement only by every other sport."
0,Homer Simpson,Mmmm... pointy.
3,Bart Simpson,That's the last time I get you guys a Christmas present at the last minute.
0,Homer Simpson,"Look at all this rock star dressing room stuff. What a sellout. Cheese plate -- oh, sorry, cubed cheese plate, lemon tea, probably for his throat..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, that's a relief, too, knowing I'm not crazy. So I guess everything really worked out for the--"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,My germs! My precious germs! They never harmed a soul! They never even had a chance! Whoever did this will never get past me!
0,Homer Simpson,Mi-mi-mi-miiiii!
0,Homer Simpson,Scottsdale? Will we stay at a Tripletree Resort?
11,Seymour Skinner,She's the only Springfield Elementary alum ever to advance to the Ivy League!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Um, excuse me, sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the Itchy and Scratchy show -- it's as good as ever. But after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had."
1,Marge Simpson,"I keep having the same dream. I'm the mother from ""Lost In Space."""
5,Lisa Simpson,"They're not dolls, they're aspiration figures. But it might work."
0,Homer Simpson,Wait. Can we have a moment in private?
11,Seymour Skinner,"Now I've gotten word that a child is using his imagination, and I've come to put a stop to it."
0,Homer Simpson,What's the matter?
0,Homer Simpson,So... where are all the friends?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, at least I'm getting some attention."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, I'm very uncomfortable having a gang of crows in our bedroom."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh man, stakeouts are so boring. I wish I had something to look at."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Well, it looks like we've found this plant's one remaining worker of bone and sinew."
7,Chief Wiggum,"No kidding, 'cause you're standing in the dip."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Henry Ford! Good to see you. As healthy and vibrant as Detroit itself.
0,Homer Simpson,Make it two kajillion.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, what's the big idea? That's my sister, man!"

3,Bart Simpson,"Uh, no."
1,Marge Simpson,Hello.
0,Homer Simpson,Leave me alone.
0,Homer Simpson,"Look at 'em standing out there. No place to go. Heh, heh. Poor guys. Hey, what if we let 'em stay here for just a few days?"
0,Homer Simpson,"All right. For you, I will give up all clear liquors."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"He's got them eating out of his hand. And to think you doubted him, Smithers."
0,Homer Simpson,Softball?
0,Homer Simpson,"Bye bye, money!"
0,Homer Simpson,I have a to do pile?
0,Homer Simpson,"These fortunes are terrible. They're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness."
3,Bart Simpson,Just one.
0,Homer Simpson,"They don't sound happy... but here comes a mob, shaking their fists in gratitude."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, that's you!"
0,Homer Simpson,French Nuclear Commissioner Etienne Ducharme.
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?"
0,Homer Simpson,Takes one to know one!
8,Ned Flanders,"Here's your room, ladies. You can catch some Z's while you earn those degrees."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Well, that's it. I've lost them forever. Now I'd like to introduce you to Lunchlady Doris, who will serve you healthy, nutritious meals..."
10,Krusty the Clown,"I could pull a better cartoon out of my A... Hey, whoa! Wasn't that great, kids?"

1,Marge Simpson,"""Third Notice,"" ""Final Notice,"" ""Some Guys are Coming.""... Ooh, what's this?"
0,Homer Simpson,The important thing is I didn't imagine it.
1,Marge Simpson,"I've gotten so much accomplished: I saved ""Lost"", watched all of ""Rome"" in a day, and got through ""Two and a Half Men"" in two and a half minutes. Then I ran out of space and had to choose between ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""Schindler's List."""
3,Bart Simpson,Every car's been harvested!
0,Homer Simpson,Sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money. Or...
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, Flanders, but uh, Marge was taken prisoner in the... Holy Land and uh..."
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm afraid we've awoken a needy giant.
0,Homer Simpson,Seat down.
1,Marge Simpson,"No housework, eh?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Yo, Hugh. Here's a little bit of U.S. hospitality. What do you think of that?"
0,Homer Simpson,I'm just gonna go take a walk around the block to calm down. I got a little excited. I'm not perfect... like Ned Flanders.
0,Homer Simpson,"Shock and Awe, losers! Shock and Awe!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Um, one box?"
0,Homer Simpson,This is Fat Load. I'd like to request a new codename.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense, Larry, your blood is bluer than any of theirs! Just give them a snootful of the old Burns charm!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm all for ethnic diversity, but this is just pandering."
1,Marge Simpson,Wow! I feel like such a nobody.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Get a grip, Simpson. You're doing fine. Now, do you have your map?"
1,Marge Simpson,Why can't kids still watch Captain Kangaroo?
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, you told her, Dad."
0,Homer Simpson,Overstay my welcome for forty years?

5,Lisa Simpson,Can we sleep with you?

9,Moe Szyslak,"Are you kiddin' me? You're the best thing to come into this bar since cable TV. And unlike cable TV, I ain't stealin' you from the Chinese restaurant across the street there."
1,Marge Simpson,A mother knows everything about her family.
1,Marge Simpson,Aren't you going to drink?
0,Homer Simpson,"It's just not fair. This Buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food..."
5,Lisa Simpson,I meant soon.
3,Bart Simpson,No! I can't do it! You're a nut bar! A whack-job! A kooka-dooka!
3,Bart Simpson,I've been using his avatar to play poker and trash his favorite restaurants on Yelp.

3,Bart Simpson,"Listen, getting people riled up is what heels do!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. Didn't they?"
0,Homer Simpson,"And if scaring old ladies don't float your boat, watch this!"
0,Homer Simpson,"I know, but which one?"

6,Grampa Simpson,"Hurry up! We got a lotta tonic to sell and a lotta towns to visit: Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom, Lake Flaccid..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers. If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say?"
0,Homer Simpson,Hey! I was listenin' to that!
0,Homer Simpson,What women really want is a guy who's confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know she'll still love him.
1,Marge Simpson,Of course we were.
0,Homer Simpson,"I'm proud of you, honey."
8,Ned Flanders,"You know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. It's like there's been a-a curse on me."

3,Bart Simpson,And now just put your pearls back on and we'll go get some coffee.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm so proud of you, honey. You bulked up, but managed to keep your femininity."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, we've been so worried about you!"
0,Homer Simpson,Where are my videogames? My X-box?! My Wii?!
1,Marge Simpson,Sounds like a plan!
0,Homer Simpson,You don't have to humiliate me.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Now it's simply a matter of bending down and picking up the one and only...
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, fire-kebab!"

0,Homer Simpson,"My old man. Well, I gotta go."
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, man. That would be so awesome!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, the thing about that is..."

0,Homer Simpson,Really? What's your handicap?
0,Homer Simpson,Listen to Lisa play her sax.
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh man, I love Oktoberfest. Oktoberfest!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Uh... I think it needs a little padding.
11,Seymour Skinner,"But due to lack of funds, Springfield Elementary is closed forever."
3,Bart Simpson,"Lis, when you get a little older you'll learn that Friday's just another day between NBC's Must-See Thursday and CBS's Saturday Night Crap-o-rama."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Aw, not through my legs. Oh, that's really rubbin' it in."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Aw, if you stay you can have anything you want to eat, even some sort of gelatin dish. It's made from hooves, you know."
0,Homer Simpson,You gotta hide me. Death is after me! And I don't entirely trust these cowboys.
1,Marge Simpson,"No, it was berry-peach!"
0,Homer Simpson,"To old man Burns, who's paying us to drink because we're embarrassing!"
3,Bart Simpson,And the winner is... Lisa Simpson!
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, everyone, straight ahead is my big surprise!"
0,Homer Simpson,"So Marge, in tomorrow's game I'm gonna recover a fumble just for you."
5,Lisa Simpson,He's right here.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, can I ask you a question?"
0,Homer Simpson,Holy moly.
1,Marge Simpson,You will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Aw, that's your answer to everything. Look at my life. I'm talkin' to a monkey and a -- I don't know what the hell you are."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Children, you can stop writing letters of support to our troops. That was just busy-work."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sh-sh-sh. Anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon..."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh that's okay, the kid don't bother me none."
1,Marge Simpson,What's that smell?
0,Homer Simpson,"I'll build you a new kitchen, sweetie."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, that's ludicrous!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Okay... Here goes.
5,Lisa Simpson,"I think it's ""new car smell."""

1,Marge Simpson,Lisa! Breakfast! We're having waffles!
1,Marge Simpson,OK. Who was George Washington Carver?
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, Mr. Burns, I'd like you to meet... Mother Hubbard standee."
0,Homer Simpson,There... and... there...
3,Bart Simpson,You plant the ants and then they grow?
0,Homer Simpson,Get away from me.
5,Lisa Simpson,Is it really worth risking your lives just for some sugar?
11,Seymour Skinner,I THINK THE RULES ARE COOL!
5,Lisa Simpson,Did you know Lisa Simpson? I heard she was pretty cool.
1,Marge Simpson,"All right, but I'm doing this because he was Remington Steele. He was Remington Steele, wasn't he?"
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh, baby! Now you're free to come back to me!"
1,Marge Simpson,Would it kill one of you to wash a bell pepper?
3,Bart Simpson,Comic Book Guy! Thanks.
3,Bart Simpson,Uh... B?
0,Homer Simpson,I know. I want to pet him again!
0,Homer Simpson,"Sucker. Competitive, violent, that's why you're here."
0,Homer Simpson,"Y'know, I feel sorry for you, kid. Going back to that cold, loveless family."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, no. Marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! Of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks..."
8,Ned Flanders,The Parson?! He's coming here?
0,Homer Simpson,Box...
3,Bart Simpson,"It's him or me, O Lord!"
0,Homer Simpson,Where do you think you're going? You're gonna listen to my story.
0,Homer Simpson,In death you saved us all.
3,Bart Simpson,"Hey, I bet you have a great smile."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Back in a moment, my dear. We have to, uh... uh... expel some urine."
1,Marge Simpson,Club soda will get that blood out.
5,Lisa Simpson,We're gonna go check out the wind damage!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, calm down. The party's not for another three hours."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"All right, you rag-tag bunch of misfits. You hate me, and I hate you even more. But without my beloved ringers, you're all I've got. So I want you to remember some inspiring things that someone else may have told you in the course of your lives, and go out there and win!"
0,Homer Simpson,Ow! Ohhh...
0,Homer Simpson,Keep walkin'
0,Homer Simpson,"Take care, ladies. I'm sure you can make it back to the prison on your own."
0,Homer Simpson,Draw the curtain.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, obviously that's impossible--"
3,Bart Simpson,"Well you're gonna win, 'cause you've got star quality. Like the Hulk in movies other than ""The Hulk."""
3,Bart Simpson,"Milhouse, how could you let this happen? You were supposed to be the night watchman."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Okay, here's the story: I belong to a very exclusive club -- The Excluders' Club..."
1,Marge Simpson,I hope someone saw our ad.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Well, I can't take that rattlesnake out of his mailbox now, now can I?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Get it out! Get it out!
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, you didn't tell me Mr. Burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant."
0,Homer Simpson,"Just call me Borders Books, 'cause I'll always be here."
0,Homer Simpson,Do you give 'em out for fans? 'Cause I'm a fan.
3,Bart Simpson,The cops can't just slap a curfew on us. We have rights.

5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'm going to play soccer."
3,Bart Simpson,This must be my half-brother and half-sister!
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, guess what! Skinner wants to bail on his wedding!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Go get it, boy!"
0,Homer Simpson,I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks I'm an idiot. The only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.
5,Lisa Simpson,"I guess I'll have to. Then I'll be queen of the world! Of spelling. That's right, queen of the world! Of spelling."
0,Homer Simpson,It doesn't matter what happened a thousand years ago. For Carl Carlson's honor has been redeemed by the deeds of Carl Carlson.
0,Homer Simpson,It's on your face too!
3,Bart Simpson,What were their names?
3,Bart Simpson,Let this be a lesson: never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule.
0,Homer Simpson,"Where, where?"
8,Ned Flanders,"Come on, boys."
3,Bart Simpson,You take my sister's bike.
1,Marge Simpson,"I'm glad you had fun, but it's time to come home."
1,Marge Simpson,"That spot says ""compact only""."
3,Bart Simpson,I wouldn't mind driving that over a prairie dog village! Honk to the driver!
1,Marge Simpson,"Now, that wasn't so bad, was it Bart? You know, sometimes the fear of some..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I've already borrowed one car. Let's go!"
0,Homer Simpson,Wait. You went to a sugar factory? Were there Oompa-Loompas?
0,Homer Simpson,"Son, from now on, I'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Says you, woman."
11,Seymour Skinner,No napkin could wipe the crumbs of failure from your mouth.

0,Homer Simpson,WHO'S NELSON?
3,Bart Simpson,"Die, weapons, die!"
6,Grampa Simpson,Son!
5,Lisa Simpson,"The first episode was just a pilot, Dad. Producers fiddle with shows all the time. They change characters, drop others, and push some into the background."
5,Lisa Simpson,"This is about as tolerant as Dad gets, so you should be flattered."
0,Homer Simpson,"Son, I love you kids. But I'm only going to the hospital one more time in my life and I ain't comin' out."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I've learned a lesson. Just because you're a lesbian, it doesn't make you less of a bein'."
3,Bart Simpson,"Dude, you got me all wrong..."
1,Marge Simpson,Vodka? Is this Krusty's?
3,Bart Simpson,I've got to get that hood ornament. No matter who owns it.
0,Homer Simpson,He still has my sweatshirt.
1,Marge Simpson,"Now listen, Bub. You go down to those recruiters and tell them Bart is too young for the Army. I don't want this to be the only memory I have of him."
1,Marge Simpson,"No, no, I don't feel like going to a trash pile today."
1,Marge Simpson,What a waste of talent.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh for... Oh, very well."
0,Homer Simpson,"Mmm... fifty dollar pretzel. Hey, what's Baby Huey doing?"
0,Homer Simpson,Doodie.
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, stop talking to yourself!"
0,Homer Simpson,A-- Wait a second. I'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools.
0,Homer Simpson,The guy who doesn't live there.
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, that sounds like ""The Sweet Smell of Success""."
0,Homer Simpson,Look at the size of that bird! I'd go Henry the Eighth on those drumsticks.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"You bumbling fool, I keep telling you I'm looking for a patsy."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah. Frankly, I'm surprised you're not across the street where they drink for fun, instead of here, where, uh, horrible addiction compels you."
5,Lisa Simpson,Could I please hear it in a sentence?
1,Marge Simpson,You went to the snack car?
0,Homer Simpson,"No, I just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, hey! What are you doing?"
6,Grampa Simpson,"She wants to steal a kiss, like Pyramus and Thisbe."
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, team, it's the fourth quarter. The Lord gave us the atoms, and it's up to us to make 'em dance!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay crew, set your faces to stunned."
0,Homer Simpson,Four walls? I was thinking more of something in a two or three.
1,Marge Simpson,It was me! I was the one who told the FBI.
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, what do I do?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Actually, I'm taking you on a ""special little guy super happy fun"" day!"
8,Ned Flanders,"There's my little Popcorn Ball. Kissy, kissy."
0,Homer Simpson,How much is this free resort weekend?
1,Marge Simpson,Homer.
5,Lisa Simpson,"The National Weather Service says dawn is still scheduled for six-twenty tomorrow, and to please stop calling."
1,Marge Simpson,No it wasn't!
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oyster shells, hand painted to resemble Lucille Ball! You'll love Oyster Lucy! Oh Mr. Mooney, I just gotta meet Bob Cummings. Vivvv!!!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm just advanced! You can catch up!
3,Bart Simpson,They back your baaaannk!
3,Bart Simpson,Because your seat was behind mine!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"And worst of all, you took the ""Hamburglar's"" birthday off last Monday and Wednesday! Which is it? Now, my voice is giving out, so I'm just going to poke you for the next hour or so."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well that is your problem, Ralph. This is how I always walk."
5,Lisa Simpson,Grazie. Idioto!
3,Bart Simpson,"Yeah. There's just no way to resist it, is there?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Prove me wrong, Silent Bob."
1,Marge Simpson,"Aww, somebody's in love."
1,Marge Simpson,"Of course, Homey. Aren't you thinking about me?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Grease yourself up and go in, you-you... guff-speaking work-slacker."
0,Homer Simpson,Bonjour.
5,Lisa Simpson,WE'RE GOING TO A REST'RANT GRAND OP'NIIIIIIIING... / BUT DON'T FILL UP ON BREAD!
0,Homer Simpson,Move along there.
9,Moe Szyslak,"I see you're new to town -- maybe I could uh, show you around? I know a terrific tavern..."
3,Bart Simpson,"Okay, let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah, legitimately, but you're too scared to do anything fun with it?"
0,Homer Simpson,"We'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to."
1,Marge Simpson,Hi Homie. I feel much better.
5,Lisa Simpson,I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU / HEART AND SOUL...
7,Chief Wiggum,Deadly toxic cloud! Deadly toxic cloud!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, he is cute. But I'm sure a boy like him would never say hello to me."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, crud. And we're so close to the house."
7,Chief Wiggum,"That's some good thinking, Lou."
10,Krusty the Clown,Now I know the reason my life is so empty. I never had a Bar Mitzvah.
7,Chief Wiggum,Dead. Definitely dead.
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm proud of you, Dad. You're the first man to ever outsource the American worker's sense of entitlement and privilege."
3,Bart Simpson,"Pardon me, master, but what does a big fat wad like you know about kung fu?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm sick of doing Japanese stuff. In jail we had to be in this dumb Kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin and I wanted to be Oshi, but they made me Ori."
3,Bart Simpson,Dad said I could try it.
0,Homer Simpson,Pound that nerd.
5,Lisa Simpson,Wait a minute. Krusty can't read.
1,Marge Simpson,You don't hear me listening to the Thompson Twins anymore. Although...
3,Bart Simpson,Gotcha!
3,Bart Simpson,Was he killed?
6,Grampa Simpson,...but Burns had unleashed the local dog catcher to bring Bongo in.
9,Moe Szyslak,Whoa. Whoa! Even the Koreans wouldn't touch this dog!
0,Homer Simpson,Treasures? Gifts? You got it all wrong. That stuff is just our old--
5,Lisa Simpson,Is it Bart?
1,Marge Simpson,"I started making some calls last night, and before I knew it, practically all of Springfield was offering to help."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, at least come out and say hello."
1,Marge Simpson,"Although I must admit, they know where to stop."
1,Marge Simpson,"Occasionally, you might hear a faint roar..."
1,Marge Simpson,You what?!
0,Homer Simpson,Dirty diapers on strings!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, it's very frustrating."
1,Marge Simpson,"But they're counting on you to take tickets. And if you sit there with a brave little smile and a festive bow, why, you could be the belle of the ball."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Smithers, I've just seen the most heroic dog on television. He pulled a toddler from the path of a speeding car, then pushed a criminal in front of it. Find this dog. I want to make him my executive vice president."
3,Bart Simpson,How's things with you and Frank?
0,Homer Simpson,"Hurry up, Moe, for the love of God! Hurry up!"
8,Ned Flanders,I need your advice. It's about a lady.
3,Bart Simpson,I wasn't gonna gamble. I just wanted a Bloody Mary.
5,Lisa Simpson,But... but I...
9,Moe Szyslak,"Boy, who decided to give every weirdo an island?"
5,Lisa Simpson,I hope it's a girl.
0,Homer Simpson,Fired... me?
8,Ned Flanders,But who'd know the difference?
1,Marge Simpson,I'm over here!
0,Homer Simpson,Shut-uuuup...
6,Grampa Simpson,MY SWEET EMBRACEABLE YOU.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, according to ""Junior Skeptic Magazine"" the chances are a hundred seventy-five million-to-one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, Apu. You got any of those potato chips that give you diarrhea? I need to do a little ""spring cleaning."""
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Get a picture of a restaurant check with no tip, put it online, say it was him. Kaboom, he's finished!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Journalistic dynamite.
3,Bart Simpson,"Or, I could write something that's not gay."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! Resistance is futile. Oh God, how I only want my bear. But he's gone. Gone forever. I'd give anything to know what happened to him."
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, Flanders, you're the boss. Heh, heh, heh."
3,Bart Simpson,"Who's that, George?"
11,Seymour Skinner,'Bye.
1,Marge Simpson,"Boy, things are going really good. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Hmm, look at that freckle. I should dig that out."
1,Marge Simpson,We've never been separated from the kids for so long. I don't know how much more I can take.
3,Bart Simpson,Hymns here! I got hymns here! Get 'em while they're holy! Fresh from God's brain to your mouth!
0,Homer Simpson,Don't touch me. Your hands feel like salad tongs.
7,Chief Wiggum,"You know, I planted that crystal meth just to meet you. I was so shy."
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I've always loved you. Bart, you were a worthy foe."
1,Marge Simpson,"Then the bird sang ""I Love The Night Life""... with clever new lyrics."
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, fall backward!"
0,Homer Simpson,I second that motion...
0,Homer Simpson,"I talked to Flanders about parenting. I'm a perfect father. Hold on, son, I'm-a coming!"
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, whatever."
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, knock it off, you perverts."
5,Lisa Simpson,Why is that mirror sneezing?
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Look at those delightful children, Smithers... all those healthy organs, ripe for the harvesting."
7,Chief Wiggum,"Y-- You? Ah, no offense, but you're a decrepit monkey skeleton."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, why'd you lock the door? We're still inside!"
9,Moe Szyslak,Fudd? I thought they took that off the market after all those hillbillies went blind.
3,Bart Simpson,"Wow, these dummies look pretty good."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, I'm very excited about this deal... Oh..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do."
1,Marge Simpson,Homer... you're not going to school.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, yeah! And I'm not easily impressed. Wow! A blue car!"

2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I don't know what ""phallocentric"" means, but no girls."
3,Bart Simpson,"Um, this is the last seat, so..."
0,Homer Simpson,Just don't dress me up like a woman.
1,Marge Simpson,"Let's go, children."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well Homer, looks like I can't go to discipline camp. Which is too bad, 'cause I think this was the thing that would finally straighten me out."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,How ironic. I survived the Titanic by making a raft out of steerage passengers and now this!
0,Homer Simpson,Why is everything Hollywood makes so excellent? Whyyyy?
0,Homer Simpson,"Nixon, Comet, Cupid... Donna Dixon."
9,Moe Szyslak,A sneeze guard.
8,Ned Flanders,"Homer, could you stop throwin' balls over my fence?"
0,Homer Simpson,Can't you stay in the Whack-A-Mole game?
0,Homer Simpson,Look at him!
9,Moe Szyslak,Wait a minute. How can you arrest Homer? This guy's the one what done the thing that why you're here for. I'm talkin' malfeasance here.
0,Homer Simpson,"You have to think, it's your job!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Bart! What are you doing here?
11,Seymour Skinner,You mean... Banff?
0,Homer Simpson,That's inspiring. What's that from? X-Men 2?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Marge, my customers don't like themselves. Therefore, they seek the darkness."
0,Homer Simpson,When did that happen?
9,Moe Szyslak,It means it's not like you're gonna break into the prison and bust him out or anything.
0,Homer Simpson,Not an issue.
1,Marge Simpson,"No, let's hear him out. He looks a little like Walter Mondale."
9,Moe Szyslak,"Aw, he's gonna ruin everything. All right, that's it Homer! Either Burns goes or Moe goes."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Ralph, are you almost finished?"
0,Homer Simpson,What the -- ?

0,Homer Simpson,"Right, naked Duffman?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,Eleanor Mackie. Eleanor Mackie. Eleanor Mackie!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Guys, look!"
3,Bart Simpson,There's gotta be something yummy out there.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh look, it's Kathy! How are things in personnel?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, my heart's beating like crazy."
1,Marge Simpson,"I too am a freak. One eye is blue, and the other a pale brown."
7,Chief Wiggum,Hold it right there.
3,Bart Simpson,"And all it will cost you is $1,000."
3,Bart Simpson,Now's our chance to be bad.
1,Marge Simpson,You always do the right thing... sort of.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Hmmm. Crude, but I like it. What do you say we freshen up our little drinkie poos?"
1,Marge Simpson,It saved our marriage!
3,Bart Simpson,"""Resting"" hung over, ""resting"" got fired..? Help me out here."
0,Homer Simpson,"Chief, my daughter's up there. You're a father too."

0,Homer Simpson,"Dad, is that story really true?"
1,Marge Simpson,You'll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall!
3,Bart Simpson,"Mom, I'm really sorry."
1,Marge Simpson,Now it's Marge's time to shine!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Just shut up and listen. There's something fishy about Grandma. Whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject. And just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house."
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, charts are for squares, baby."
0,Homer Simpson,Take that off this second!
1,Marge Simpson,I think she just answers their phone...
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mr. Flanders, wait!"
1,Marge Simpson,I would like it. You never come to my mother's.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"It's a remarkable thing. In the short time you were gone, I learned to be completely self reli--"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Have you been to Homer's house?! It's got a back yard, a front yard... the place is like yard city!"
0,Homer Simpson,It worked! It's a miracle!
0,Homer Simpson,It may be on a lousy channel but the Simpsons are on TV!
3,Bart Simpson,I'd like a moment to ourselves.
0,Homer Simpson,"You may be a smart kid, Lisa, but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, as long as I'm paying for the time..."

3,Bart Simpson,Ooo... Granny killing me!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey-hey! Can't get enough Itchy and Scratchy! And now it's time for-- Another Itchy and Scratchy?! Who's the star of this show, me or--"
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. I never realized how much I missed it. Listen to the murmurs in the next room. The house is full of life again."
11,Seymour Skinner,What I wouldn't give for something to interrupt this awkward moment.
5,Lisa Simpson,Is that why you're sitting on an ice cream sandwich?
5,Lisa Simpson,Is too.
0,Homer Simpson,"The joke's on you, buddy. There's no bullets in that thing."
3,Bart Simpson,Dad! Funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in Hall G!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Just what's going on here?
9,Moe Szyslak,"Oh, I'm happy. I'm very happy. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. See? Now waste your family and I'll give you a beer!"
0,Homer Simpson,It's not that simple. I've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.
5,Lisa Simpson,Fine. I was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy.
9,Moe Szyslak,Um. You ain't gonna like what you see.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Supplying false information on a national park register is a federal offense...
11,Seymour Skinner,"Uh, why, we're... We're, uh, on a... a, uh Uh, uh, what do you call... uh, field trip."
0,Homer Simpson,Oh great. Who are you in love with? Bart?
1,Marge Simpson,It's only fair. We went to Europe when Lisa lost her balloon.
0,Homer Simpson,Then there's champagne in me! What am I gonna do? It's less than twenty-four hours till my drug test. Maybe I can sweat it out.
1,Marge Simpson,And I wouldn't blame him. You destroyed our son's self-esteem.
5,Lisa Simpson,I think so.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Uh...ehhh... deeee... eeee... deeaar... Dear... Krust...""y""...?"
10,Krusty the Clown,All these rules--I feel like I'm in a strip club!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Well, there is one fun fact I've been saving for an emergency situation. Did you know there really was a Duncan Hines?"
1,Marge Simpson,"It's so sweet of you to take us out like this, Homie. Come on, kids, three cheers for your father! Hip hip--"
11,Seymour Skinner,Right. Time capsule. Nelson. Give me something.
1,Marge Simpson,Be right back.
1,Marge Simpson,Ohh...kids have been doing that one since my day.
5,Lisa Simpson,We haven't gotten our food yet!
5,Lisa Simpson,"...three, two, one..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, Mr. Smithers!"
8,Ned Flanders,"Indeedily-doodily I do, and I love him just as much as you! It's a Flanders sandwich with great neighbor bread!"
8,Ned Flanders,Church!
3,Bart Simpson,We're both in the same reading group. I think you know how smart I am.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus."
0,Homer Simpson,"You kids should thank your mother. Now that she's a better person, we can see how awful we really are."
11,Seymour Skinner,I can't write this. It's a grammatical nightmare.
1,Marge Simpson,"Don't mess with me, I've got jimmies!"
0,Homer Simpson,What kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot?!
0,Homer Simpson,Where do you get those things anyway?
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, my friend, I haven't learned a thing."
0,Homer Simpson,You laugh now but you won't be laughing soon.
3,Bart Simpson,Oh yeah. / That's it.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,We were just in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by.
0,Homer Simpson,"When I get old, Marge, I want you to promise you'll put me in a home. It's like being a baby, only you're old enough to appreciate it."
3,Bart Simpson,Wait... I have an idea.
0,Homer Simpson,"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Stupid bus that can't even go to the stupid place it's supposed to stupid go.
5,Lisa Simpson,When are you gonna start taking responsibility for your actions?
0,Homer Simpson,"Don't worry. I've got a plan. Okay, Ned, the first thing we have to do is..."
5,Lisa Simpson,There's no light rail in Springfield.
8,Ned Flanders,Who? Maude and me?
0,Homer Simpson,"Come here, you little--"
1,Marge Simpson,"Hollywood, here we are!"
3,Bart Simpson,Do you know what Radon is?
1,Marge Simpson,"Postage, marked in pesetas? Who are those letters from?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Nothing in common, eh? Tell me more..."
5,Lisa Simpson,Fathers have to say that stuff.
0,Homer Simpson,"Awwww, want a bite?"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"A word of caution, young Woosterfield: watch out for those closest to you."
0,Homer Simpson,Y'ello?
3,Bart Simpson,"Ma, I need a glass of milk."
3,Bart Simpson,"Happy Birthday, Dad."
0,Homer Simpson,"Ooh, I forgot crotch grabbing. That'll be the sun."
0,Homer Simpson,You did this?! With your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!
11,Seymour Skinner,You're actually giving everyone in town a Christmas present?
5,Lisa Simpson,She doesn't like lying on the beach! She likes being in the ocean!
0,Homer Simpson,You said you'd go to the prom with me.
6,Grampa Simpson,Get outta here.
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, I really don't wanna do that, Ned."
8,Ned Flanders,"He's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure."
1,Marge Simpson,I brought home fried chicken...
0,Homer Simpson,"No! If I leave the plane, I'll be just like everyone else!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Hey, Duffman. Let's see how you like a sticker on your face!"
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, not bad. I'm starting to get the hang of the floor waxer."
6,Grampa Simpson,WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT?
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, we pay Bart five dollars a week to take out the trash..."
3,Bart Simpson,"As much as I hate that man right now, you gotta love that suit."
1,Marge Simpson,"We drove around until 3 a.m. looking for another ""All You Can Eat"" fish restaurant."
3,Bart Simpson,"Well, if it's in a Gallery, how is it street art?"
3,Bart Simpson,She's heading for Prairie Dog Village!
9,Moe Szyslak,Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.
0,Homer Simpson,A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here.
5,Lisa Simpson,It looks like a vortex -- a gateway into another dimension.
1,Marge Simpson,"That's a very nice jig, Kearney. Now, isn't dancing much more fun than bullying?"
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?"
1,Marge Simpson,"I love him, too. G'night."
6,Grampa Simpson,"Back in nineteen forty-four, I was stationed over there and I met a beautiful girl..."
5,Lisa Simpson,Girl Scout cookies get you in anywhere.
1,Marge Simpson,This has been one of the most magical evenings of my life.
3,Bart Simpson,We've got a little planning to do. Step into my office.
0,Homer Simpson,You don't know the new me of the last few days at all!
2,C. Montgomery Burns,The negotiations have failed! Shoot him!
1,Marge Simpson,He's not my little baby anymore. Maybe I mother him too much.
3,Bart Simpson,Cool! We should try that at school!
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, so are the Grammy judges. --"
0,Homer Simpson,"Now, if I fart, that's 'cause I'm so relaxed."
6,Grampa Simpson,Hey there!
5,Lisa Simpson,You're not going anywhere near Annie.
1,Marge Simpson,Marge.
5,Lisa Simpson,I understand. I'll just read a magazine.
0,Homer Simpson,Why not?
1,Marge Simpson,Bart! Be quiet!
3,Bart Simpson,"Wait, I know. Beer here!"
5,Lisa Simpson,What a perfect way to end our day in New York.
0,Homer Simpson,Uh-oh. Here comes the gospel according to puke.
3,Bart Simpson,Basically him and Dad.
0,Homer Simpson,I could fly too if I didn't have a wife and three kids!
1,Marge Simpson,It was wearing a hat!
0,Homer Simpson,Well... I didn't really feel like going to Moe's today... thought I might hang out here for as long as I can take it.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Hurry everyone, roll in the shards!"
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Now see here, flatfoot..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, I need to get some sleep! I have a test tomorrow in birds suddenly appear. I mean, English."
3,Bart Simpson,"You're up to something, aren't you?"
10,Krusty the Clown,I hope all you kids come out this weekend and really pack this place just to show 'em how grateful I am. I told them you would. Don't make me a liar.
1,Marge Simpson,Stop calling her that!
9,Moe Szyslak,Six seconds.
1,Marge Simpson,Daddy's not on fire.
0,Homer Simpson,"Son, I know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. But since then, I've really come to respect you. And unlike love, respect can't be bought."
5,Lisa Simpson,What do you do Tuesdays and Thursdays after school?
3,Bart Simpson,"What happened? Where's my cake? It's all right, isn't it?"
3,Bart Simpson,Because nobody ever suspects the butterfly.
3,Bart Simpson,Other brother and sister?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, there's something unsatisfying about scrubbing these rocks. And I think I know what it is..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Mom, Bart sprayed whipped cream in my eye!"
3,Bart Simpson,Back pats?! This is a break up!
8,Ned Flanders,"Yeah, you."
10,Krusty the Clown,She sure knows me.
0,Homer Simpson,"Okay, that didn't work. But I know something that will..."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Wow, a bustling metropolitan newsroom, funnelling scoops from all over the globe."
0,Homer Simpson,We're out of donuts!
0,Homer Simpson,Per-fect.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh, knock it off, Homer. You're the fattest one in the car..."
0,Homer Simpson,And the peanuts in your mouth.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Why do you assume that I won't pick something fun? Let's see... Oh, this looks very educatio--"
9,Moe Szyslak,"Yeah, well, when I realized we hadn't had no ladies in here since 1979, I turned it into an office."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Oh, come on, Bart, not again."
1,Marge Simpson,And this goes too.
5,Lisa Simpson,Can we have wine?
5,Lisa Simpson,Fine. Just get in here.
1,Marge Simpson,It's May!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ew... so, do you think my family will ever forgive me for making them a laughing stock?"
1,Marge Simpson,Where's Ben?
0,Homer Simpson,You sure you're not mad?
5,Lisa Simpson,"They call her the Cat Lady. People say she's crazy, just because she has a few dozen cats. But can anyone who loves animals that much really be crazy?"
5,Lisa Simpson,Mom's counting cards at the casino!
0,Homer Simpson,"I told you, yes. Now Bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel."
0,Homer Simpson,"No, she won't. When it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin' more, MORE! MORE! And if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return."
3,Bart Simpson,I never noticed.
0,Homer Simpson,ALLOUETTE JAUNTE ALLOUETTE / ALLOUETTE JAUNTE...
3,Bart Simpson,But my apologies always sound so forced.
3,Bart Simpson,Can I have it for thirty-five?
7,Chief Wiggum,"Ow, dammit! There's some things they just don't teach you in the Police Academy movies."
0,Homer Simpson,Clowns are funny.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,How much for your entire collection?
0,Homer Simpson,Don't you have criminals to catch?
0,Homer Simpson,"No, I didn't!"
3,Bart Simpson,"This little trap is gonna make my Dad angrier than he's ever been. In the meantime, I gotta tell those internet guys to hold tight."
1,Marge Simpson,"I haven't been in a play since high school, and I thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults."
3,Bart Simpson,Why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt? That's where cooties come from.
5,Lisa Simpson,Jack LaLanne!
1,Marge Simpson,"Besides, I like some of the noises you make in bed."
0,Homer Simpson,Perhaps my other eye will get to the bottom of this.
3,Bart Simpson,I'm here to see Grampa.
0,Homer Simpson,"Dirty love. I mean, thirty love. I mean, anyone for penis? I'll just get the shuttlecock."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, I'm making the Chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. And with your blessing, I'd like to tie it to the Cowboys plus five at Chicago."
3,Bart Simpson,Now can we go home?
3,Bart Simpson,"Look at all these bootleg videos! ""Alien Autopsy"" ""Illegal Alien Autopsy"", ""Godfather III -- Good Version""..."
3,Bart Simpson,Bo-ring. I'll take you to a place that's really romantic.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,Collecting dog waste.
3,Bart Simpson,"If I could be any type of shark, I'd be a tiger shark. How 'bout you, Milhouse?"
0,Homer Simpson,There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders... the water department... God...
10,Krusty the Clown,"Hey, I do more than TV. I had a one-man show on Broadway. That's who showed up -- one man! Long story short, I won a Drama Desk Award."
0,Homer Simpson,I get it -- the midget represents dwarves.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, those should be your millions."
0,Homer Simpson,"Well, I suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured..."
0,Homer Simpson,"North. ""South."" Nuts to this! I'm going to take a shortcut."
3,Bart Simpson,"What are we going to do, hang ourselves?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"So Dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?"
0,Homer Simpson,Because you're all terrible sinners.
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, no. I've got half a beer in there! And ""Bewitched"" is on!"
9,Moe Szyslak,"You want to ""buy a round?"" I heard about that in bartending school, but I never seen it happen."
5,Lisa Simpson,"No, Buttercup! No!"
3,Bart Simpson,That nerds conduct electricity.
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello, police? Can you send a SWAT team to 742 Evergreen Ter..."
1,Marge Simpson,"Artie, please!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, I can't feel my legs!"
1,Marge Simpson,COMING OUT OF MY EIGHT-TRACK...
0,Homer Simpson,Wait for it... wait for it...
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"We've only got two days left, so I'd advise you to shut up and paint!"
0,Homer Simpson,Full power!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Dad, you really should be watching the road."
0,Homer Simpson,Now I have to face stupid reality again!... Flanders! My socks feel dirty! Gimme some water to wash 'em!
0,Homer Simpson,"Where's the ""ee-yow?"""
0,Homer Simpson,"We know. Frank Grimes, Jr."
0,Homer Simpson,"Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him."
3,Bart Simpson,Isn't this the greatest day ever?!
0,Homer Simpson,"Yeah, well, Merry Christmas."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh, I'm gonna get you for that, you little scamp!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm still trying to figure out what's bothering Lisa. I don't know, Bart's such a handful, and Maggie needs attention, but all the while our little Lisa's becoming a young woman."
0,Homer Simpson,Well that depends on what your teachers say. If you've been good... pizza. If you've been bad... uh... ... let's see... poison.
8,Ned Flanders,"Well, I got excited for nothing."
0,Homer Simpson,He'll tell us what to do.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Is there? Controlled nuclear fission is a demanding mistress, Snappy."
1,Marge Simpson,How did you make it?
1,Marge Simpson,Sunny?
3,Bart Simpson,Hungry. So hungry. There's nothing to eat. Except this.
5,Lisa Simpson,The man is an idiot!
5,Lisa Simpson,"If you need me, I'll be upstairs saying goodbye to my dreams."
1,Marge Simpson,"And these fake movie reviews are so mean, it's hilarious."
0,Homer Simpson,That better not mean what it means when I say it.
0,Homer Simpson,"And this riptide is certainly nothing Daddy can't struggle against. Help! Help! Somebody, help!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?"
6,Grampa Simpson,You! First you stole my wife... and now you're tryin' to steal my family!
1,Marge Simpson,All you can drink... if you buy a jumbo cup.
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, Homer."
0,Homer Simpson,"Seth, Munchie, they can destroy our bodies and our ponchos, but they can never silence our song of protest. ""UPTOWN GIRL / SHE'S BEEN LIVING IN HER WHITE-BREAD WORLD..."" Come on, guys... UPTOWN GIRL..."
1,Marge Simpson,Why don't you bring this potato? It's pretty big.
1,Marge Simpson,He brought home your homework when you were sick.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Excuse me, but Buzzard's Roost is a converted parking lot."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I wish we had bought the more expensive theater tickets. I'll never see anything in row ""BB""."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wake up, boy."
0,Homer Simpson,What? That's how guys talk.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,This is no game!
0,Homer Simpson,Great idea. Then we should call the doctor about this.
0,Homer Simpson,Don't worry. You gotta hit it just right. Like Fonzie.
9,Moe Szyslak,Yes I dast!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Someone's gotta stop her from going through with this fight. This goes against every feminist bone in my body, but Dad, can't you control your woman?"
0,Homer Simpson,Mmm... Homer-oats.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Please don't accept this invitation, Dad. Hunting is cruel."
3,Bart Simpson,"Hmmm, hmmm. Looking for the spot... Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm... Still checking. This is so stupid... I'm not gonna find anything... Just because I wrecked something she worked really hard on and I made her cr... Uh-oh!"
5,Lisa Simpson,It's a movie version of a cartoon family you can see for free on TV.
3,Bart Simpson,He died as he lived -- like a dork.
1,Marge Simpson,Who are those freaks?
1,Marge Simpson,I'll have one of those.
0,Homer Simpson,"Stupid movies. Who invented these dumb things anyway? Was it you, Bart?"
4,Milhouse Van Houten,"Samantha, I went to Circus of Values to buy you a ten gallon tub of Gummy Bears."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Step right up, and bid on items donated by local businesses!"
3,Bart Simpson,"You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask."
0,Homer Simpson,Mmmm... re-circulated air.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder."
1,Marge Simpson,You tell Bart all the time. You told him this morning.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Look! A blue-collar bar! Oh, Smithers, let's go slumming!"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Uh, I'd like to, but I'm afraid he has diplomatic immunity."
3,Bart Simpson,"Lis, look!"
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, there's a rec room off the kitchen, but sometimes it's there and sometimes it isn't. Our house is very odd that way."
1,Marge Simpson,"Well... Homer got along so well with the other dads, I couldn't break it to him."
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh. Well I'm not crawling back to big electricity! From now on, the Simpsons are living intermittently."
0,Homer Simpson,Bonded?! How many times?
0,Homer Simpson,Oh yeah? With what?
3,Bart Simpson,"Larry, you saved my life! You're the most wonderful stuffed lamb in the world! I'm sorry about the mean things I said. We'll have the rest of the weekend to--"
0,Homer Simpson,"Huh? Hey, how'd you get in here?"
0,Homer Simpson,So what time does this play start?
0,Homer Simpson,Wait a minute. What is it my Dad always said to me?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Here you go, Ralph."
1,Marge Simpson,Shush!
8,Ned Flanders,Can I call you Jim?
0,Homer Simpson,"You know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental."
1,Marge Simpson,Maybe it needs more fertilizer.
5,Lisa Simpson,"Ahm... I wasn't a hundred per cent clear on that. She said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get Bart to the emergency room."
5,Lisa Simpson,Hmmm... Pablo Neruda said laughter is the language of the soul.
6,Grampa Simpson,"Oh yeah, ""The Fury of the Fjords""..."
0,Homer Simpson,Lisa! Motorcade!
0,Homer Simpson,"Geez, Marge, tell the neighborhood."
0,Homer Simpson,No dice!
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you've recovered and we can all get back to normal. If Maggie could talk I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you."
3,Bart Simpson,Plane tickets!
4,Milhouse Van Houten,I'm a robber!
1,Marge Simpson,"I don't know. Lisa, tonight is very important. Mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one."
11,Seymour Skinner,Bart!!
1,Marge Simpson,I read an article about it at the tire store. Did you know it's not named after someone named Wayne Scott?
3,Bart Simpson,Whatever. Just tell Wendell I said bye.
0,Homer Simpson,"... And thank you most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single proven fatality, at least in this country. Amen."
8,Ned Flanders,All right! A chance to make a new friend!
11,Seymour Skinner,Hello? Mother?... I'll be right there. Now she wants to get out of the tub.
5,Lisa Simpson,Do you do it with relish?
0,Homer Simpson,"Hello? Oh, hi, Lenny... No. Why would I need a ride this afternoon?"
10,Krusty the Clown,"Without a Bar Mitzvah, I'm nothing!"
1,Marge Simpson,Perfect! Perfect!
0,Homer Simpson,"Yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man."
0,Homer Simpson,I'm so lame!
5,Lisa Simpson,Gosh. This is all happening so fast. I don't know what to say.
0,Homer Simpson,"Uh, Marge? 'Scuse me. Uh, I think I need a reboot."
7,Chief Wiggum,"All right, Sven-golly. You're gonna untangle this guy's noodle and that's it. No more hypnotizing anyone."
1,Marge Simpson,Hmmm huh.
1,Marge Simpson,"Well, I just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco."
0,Homer Simpson,Thou sayest it!
3,Bart Simpson,Time to get that hood's ornament.
0,Homer Simpson,The sun.
0,Homer Simpson,Better turn up the heat.
0,Homer Simpson,Marge? What are you doing here? This bar is for singles and wingmen only.
1,Marge Simpson,We understand perfectly well!
0,Homer Simpson,Nuh-uh. It isn't filled until it's spilled.
3,Bart Simpson,"Oh, what's it for?"
1,Marge Simpson,"They can't charge me for something I use every day. What's next, a spatula tax?"
1,Marge Simpson,Hmmm... Hostage negotiations.
10,Krusty the Clown,"Get off, damn you! Ah!"
0,Homer Simpson,"What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor?"
3,Bart Simpson,"Dear Lord, if you keep Homer from embarrassing us today, we promise to build several churches in your honor."
3,Bart Simpson,You're a lizard.
1,Marge Simpson,"Okay, you two. Lights out."
5,Lisa Simpson,ALL OF THE OTHER REINDEER / USED TO LAUGH AND CALL HIM NAMES...
3,Bart Simpson,"Hello, is Al there?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Ooh, there's the bus. Goodbye, sweetheart!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hm. An essay contest. ""Children under twelve""... ""Three hundred words""... ""Fiercely pro-American."" Sounds interesting."
9,Moe Szyslak,Let's get renovatin'.
1,Marge Simpson,See!
5,Lisa Simpson,Bart! Your plan worked!
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh sure you can, sweetie. Just don't make a habit of it."
1,Marge Simpson,"DON'T ARGUE WITH MARGE, I KNOW WHAT'S BEST / THE ONLY RAP IN THIS CRIB, KEEPS SANDWICHES FRESH!"
5,Lisa Simpson,Oh my God! You won the pot? You must have nearly a million dollars! I can go to college and live like a Kennedy.
10,Krusty the Clown,Let me start by getting out of the dumpster!
5,Lisa Simpson,"Happy Anniversary, Mom and Dad!"
7,Chief Wiggum,Nope. Tear gas.
5,Lisa Simpson,Mom! Make Dad tell the story right.
0,Homer Simpson,I guess I learned something here. God is capable of great anger and great mercy. But mostly great anger.
0,Homer Simpson,"Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope."
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, you can't just reroute the gas line. Do you know how dangerous that is?"
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh! When he's totally immersed in a foreign language, the average child can become fluent in weeks."
3,Bart Simpson,"Nelson, what are you doing?!"
0,Homer Simpson,Come on. Lick it!
0,Homer Simpson,"But you do get to express yourself. In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve."
1,Marge Simpson,I want my kids in a decent school!
0,Homer Simpson,I never realized how hot this suit is. I'm sweating out all my blood-lust!
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, a Krispy Kreme would really clean up down here."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, treadmill! How do you like this incline?"
0,Homer Simpson,Nothing's gonna stop me now.
5,Lisa Simpson,It looks like you're not the only predatory opportunist in town.
3,Bart Simpson,"I'll use these spray cans as jet packs and fly to safety. So long, losers!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Regardless, I see no reason to believe that ""Bender"" is from the future. Robotic technology today is very advanced."
0,Homer Simpson,"Someday you'll thank me for this, son."
9,Moe Szyslak,No. We're phasing out the games. People drink less when they're havin' fun.
1,Marge Simpson,"Oh well, Thank you, Doctor, you've changed my life!"
1,Marge Simpson,"This is even better than our screensaver. And I love our screensaver. Nicely done, Lisa."
3,Bart Simpson,"I can help, but it's gonna get rough."
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hello, Isabel? Listen..."
0,Homer Simpson,"Boy, when God closes a door, he opens a window."
0,Homer Simpson,"Wait, don't go! I wanna keep on rockin'. C'mon guys... a-one, a-two..."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"With the departure of Mr. Marley, there will now be an entry-level position open in Sector 7G. Now get out. The bar is closed."
7,Chief Wiggum,"What's this, a bird?"
0,Homer Simpson,"This is 'cause I kicked you, isn't it?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"I never realized before, but some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny."
10,Krusty the Clown,Please . Stop it. What's going... Who are you people?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, we used to date. Plus, he threatened me."
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"I said, DO IT! NOW, DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Well, I'm looking for a new faith. One that isn't so materialistic."
0,Homer Simpson,Just like when I smell up the toilet.
0,Homer Simpson,It's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... My father is interesting?! The whole world's upside down! That must mean Cathy is funny.
11,Seymour Skinner,Prisoners in our own school. Hey...
1,Marge Simpson,Thanks for taking the job. I'm sorry my husband is being so difficult.
3,Bart Simpson,What are you girls talkin' about?
0,Homer Simpson,"So, how's the tribe comin' along? Any papooses?"
1,Marge Simpson,"Homer, I don't know if I can ever forgive you. Please go away."
0,Homer Simpson,"Quiet, Lisa. You're scaring your mother."
5,Lisa Simpson,Like those chairs in the music room?
5,Lisa Simpson,"Hey, these aren't waffles -- these are just square pancakes!"
5,Lisa Simpson,I'm Lisa Simpson and you're the first person I've met here who cares about our animal equals.
6,Grampa Simpson,What are you trying to prove?
1,Marge Simpson,"Lisa, lots of times two incompatible things can both be true. My son's a brat but he's a special little guy. Your father says he's at work, but there he is jumping on a trampoline."
0,Homer Simpson,"Hey, everybody!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Oh man, this is long. Could you read it to me?"
11,Seymour Skinner,Living history.
7,Chief Wiggum,Make more or I shoot!
10,Krusty the Clown,"Well then, why are you here?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Beautiful dinnerware, Mrs. Parkfield."
11,Seymour Skinner,"Oh, I'm not worried."
5,Lisa Simpson,No you're not!
3,Bart Simpson,Maybe you just put it on auto-reverse.
3,Bart Simpson,But Goliath is dead. I smote him myself. I smoted him good.
3,Bart Simpson,"Maybe I can make some money, Dad. My magic act is really coming along."
0,Homer Simpson,You? No way. It's too dangerous.
3,Bart Simpson,I smash fluorescent lights at the gravel pit.
2,C. Montgomery Burns,"Dammit, I forget!"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Of course. Gosh, Dad, your hands are shaking!"
0,Homer Simpson,"Is ""TV Guide"" a book?"
0,Homer Simpson,"I don't get it. Football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. Why can't I just remember which cards have been played?"
5,Lisa Simpson,"Bart, let's stop this stupid rivalry. Even if you never become a great sorcerer, you're still an okay brother."
1,Marge Simpson,Really? I never knew that.
6,Grampa Simpson,You Korean girls know what a soldier likes.
7,Chief Wiggum,"Okay, coarse gunpowder... get the ball in there... don't forget the wadding... tamp, tamp, tamp... fine gunpowder in the pan... firing stance, take careful aim... and..."
5,Lisa Simpson,They calm down when they're near the Springfield Silvertongues!
0,Homer Simpson,"Sure, boy."
5,Lisa Simpson,"I'm gonna ask people if they know their servants' last names, or, in the case of butlers, their first."
0,Homer Simpson,"None. No wait, three. Since the last one, I don't remember so good."
